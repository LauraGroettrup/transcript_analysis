"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.608803868293762|" They're so in sync with each other."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.502163767814636|"You're right. Someday I hope I'll find someone I can share everything with…like they do.But until my father starts letting me go out more often, that probably won't be happening."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.731830596923828|"Are you sure your dad won't let you come? It's such a bummer."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.381761193275452|"You know how overprotective he is. One day he'll realize I'm not a child anymore, but we're not quite there yet. "
"Nino"|"Marinette"|0.656136512756348|" Big finish, here we go!"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.237223148345947|" You don't wanna miss this. "
"Nino"|"Nora"|0.261122941970825|"Yeah! "
"Nora"|"Alya"|-0.186432898044586|" Aw, shoot. Did I miss the ballet?"
"Alya"|"Nora"|-0.16407573223114|" Nora, is your match over already?"
"Nora"|"Alya"|-0.182318806648254|"First round: total knockout. Huh-huh-huh.As usual.I told you a hundred times not to call me Nora in front of people, little sis.The name is Anansi, like a spider."
"Alya"|"Nora"|0.0543692111968994|" Sure, I'll call you Anansi when you stop calling me 'little sis'."
"Nora"|"Alya"|0.217986702919006|" Anyway, what are you all still doing here this late? Don't you have school tomorrow?"
"Alya"|"Nora"|0.438929319381714|" We're waiting for it to get dark. It's the World Cup fireworks show tonight, remember? We're gonna watch from the Ferris wheel."
"Nora"|"Marinette"|-0.540784746408463|"Oh no! Baguette and cappie can go with cellphone boy if they want, but you're staying here.It's way too dangerous."
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.622961282730103|" But Nora—I mean, Anansi, you can't do that!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.586801618337631|" Yeah, no way dude, we're not going without Alya!"
"Alya"|"Nora"|-0.21133279800415|" Listen, I appreciate you worrying about me and all, but I'm not a little girl anymore. Besides, Mom and Dad are totally cool with it."
"Nora"|"Alya"|-0.533508867025375|" Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk, there have been way too many akumatized peeps in Paris these last few weeks. Look how many times you've been in direct danger.So you're staying home, safe and sound, period!"
"Alya"|"Nora"|-0.754140853881836|" That's so ridiculous! The twins were akumatized right here at home. "
"Nora"|"Alya"|-0.733468651771545|" Well, that would've never happened on my watch. I won't let anybody mess with my family."
"Alya"|"Adrien"|-0.136602997779846|"You mean like the other day at the square?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.688606411218643|"What happened?"
"Marinette"|"Nora"|-0.0554611682891846|" Well… we came across a man handing out flyersNora thought the man was akumatized and wanted to turn Alya into a banana-zombie."
"Nora"|"Marinette"|-0.773438647389412|" Uh...uh...how was I supposed to know it was some stupid costume? And besides, what would happen if the Ferris wheel stopped working 'cause some akumatized dude refused to pay his fare? Once you fly-weights can actually defend yourselves like mewe'll talk about it."
"Marinette"|"Nora"|-0.601961553096771|" It doesn't matter, because Ladybug and Cat Noir would save us if there were any problems."
"Nora"|"Nino"|-0.563074946403503|" Uh-huh. And what if Mister Whiskers is catching a mouse and that Beetle's been sprayed with bug spray? What do you do then? "
"Nino"|"Nora"|0.534590482711792|" I can protect Alya if I have to."
"Nora"|"Nino"|-0.576387345790863|" Oh yeah? And how exactly are you planning to defeat the villain? A dance-off? "
"Nino"|"Nora"|-0.14518404006958|"I'd… do anything to protect Alya. "
"Nora"|"Alya"|0.0963623523712158|" Hmm, ha! Okay, Alya can go out with you guys…if… you beat me at an arm wrestle."
"Alya"|"Adrien"|-0.76210780441761|" Please, don't arm-wrestle on my account. I don't need to be protected."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.722933351993561|"Nino, you don't stand a chance against Anansi; she's way too strong."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.115031003952026|"Hey, dude!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.530187249183655|" Sorry, Nino; I'm sure we'll work something out."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.339874744415283|" We gotta go, or else we'll miss the fireworks."
"Alya"|"Marinette and Nino"|-0.711454004049301|"Forget it; you guys go without me."
"Marinette and Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?!"
"Marinette"|"Nino and Alya"|-0.645738959312439|" No way!Okay, Nino will arm-wrestle you."
"Nino and Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.612575769424438|" What? "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.541285753250122|" Nino will prove his worth to us that he can defend Alya and every one of us, because—"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.257256865501404|"Marinette, what are you doing?"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|0.293315291404724|"Don't worry, I got this.Because… uhh, because love and, uh, friendship, mmm, make your muscles bulge."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.373223423957825|"Yeah, thanks Marinette."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|0.589290618896484|"All right! In position. Ready. Set.Go!"
"Nino"|"Nora"|-0.397783815860748|" Yaaaaa! "
"Nora"|"Alya"|0.249763011932373|" Really? Is that all you got?"
"Alya"|"Nora"|-0.751447826623917|" She's gonna rip his arm off. "
"Nora"|"Marinette"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Marinette"|"Nora"|0.0237938165664673|"Over there, an akuma! "
"Nora"|"Adrien"|-0.612575769424438|"What?!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.410277009010315|" And the winner is… Nino!"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.701044768095016|"Oops, my bad; it was just a fly."
"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.560151398181915|" Hmm? "
"Marinette"|"Nora"|0.562982201576233|" You rock, Nino. Come on, let's go. If we leave now we'll get there just in time."
"Nora"|"Alya"|-0.804021060466766|"You're a bunch of cheaters. There's no way I could've been beaten by that fly-weight. If I hadn't been distracted, I—"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.655812293291092|" That's it, Nora! You lost the challenge, so deal with it. I've had it with your overprotective big-sis-smothering. I'm going out with my BFFs and I don't care what you think. Alya out. "
"Marinette"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.721128404140472|" Uh, see you, Nora—I mean, Anansi. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Nora"|0.403141975402832|" A big sister with the best of intentions, unappreciated and unwanted — ideal prey for my akumas.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize her broken spirit!"
"Nora"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.736381351947784|"They don't understand. They have no idea of the dangers. They're so clueless."
"Hawk Moth"|"Nora"|0.125145435333252|"Anansi, I am Hawk Moth. They didn't want your support and protection. Well, I'm giving you the power to show them just how dangerous the world really is. In return, you must defeat Ladybug and Cat Noir and bring me their Miraculous."
"Nora"|"Marinette"|0.301810741424561|" Let the match begin, Hawk Moth. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.28569483757019|" Just in time! Look at that!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.445419609546661|" Wow!What's up?"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.759307563304901|" Oh, ah… nothing."

"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.717013388872147|"I don't see anything. Maybe it was a bird."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.62494033575058|"Dude, please don't tell me we're gonna be stuck up here!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.468942582607269|"I thought you said you were going to protect us."
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.672721058130264|"Over there!A supervillain! "
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.671898901462555|"Uh, may-maybe you shouldn't film her, Alya. You don't wanna attract her over here."
"Alya"|"Adrien"|0.41620659828186|" A new scoop for the Ladyblog. Ladybug and Cat Noir should be showing up any minute."
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.744300752878189|"Uh… uh… I think my wifi is losing signal.My friends are in danger."
"Adrien"|"Anansi"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"

"Anansi"|"Cat Noir"|-0.427847564220428|" Nora's not here to protect you anymore. I am Anansi, super-spider. "
"Cat Noir"|"Anansi"|-0.723502576351166|"All those arms, that's convenient, but you destroyed my scratching post."
"Anansi"|"Alya"|0.44926655292511|" Need a hand, kitty cat? "
"Alya"|"Anansi"|-0.58487468957901|"Nora… no!"
"Anansi"|"Anansi"|-0.724758744239807|" You're no match for me, kitten.Go fetch the Ferris wheel."
"Anansi"|"Nino"|-0.425474762916565|" Now that you can't cheat anymore, cappie, show us just how you plan to protect your friends.Come and get her if you're not a fly-weight!"

"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.490321397781372|"I'm not a fly-weight and I don't need your help to prove it! "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.638372927904129|"Tikki, I think I messed up; we've gotta stop Nino...and save Alya!"
"Marinette"|"Female civilian"|-0.499254763126373|"Tikki, spots on! Ah!"
"Female civilian"|"Ladybug"|0.554375052452087|" Thank you, Cat Noir."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.24738085269928|" You do pretty well without me, I see."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.350592374801636|" Yup, but it's so much nicer when you're here, M'Lady."
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.416139006614685|" Let's go show that spider what two superheroes are capable of! Ha!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.557039171457291|" Alya! "
"Alya"|"Anansi"|-0.697360277175903|" Nino, don't stick around."
"Anansi"|"Nino"|0.543481349945068|" Well, well, well. Look who it is."
"Nino"|"Anansi"|-0.41607654094696|"Anansi! You let Alya go right now! "
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.755547508597374|" Oh yeah?And how exactly is a weak little fly-weight gonna force me to release my prisoner?"
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|-0.540147364139557|" Watch out! You need to leave this to the professionals. "
"Nino"|"Anansi"|-0.522705465555191|"This isn't over, spider!"
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.374748945236206|"So it's two versus one now? Fine with me! Round two… fight! "
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.624045819044113|" Cat Noir! "
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.00285071134567261|" On the floor already? We just started! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.244829058647156|" Are you okay? "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.695149570703506|" Everything except my pride."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0695226192474365|" The Akuma must be in her headgear."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.647841691970825|" Yeah, but she's so strong we can't even get near her."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0307692289352417|" Okay, change of plan. I take care of Anansi, you release the prisoner; it'll distract her enough to drop her guard."
"Cat Noir"|"Anansi"|0.00671482086181641|" Look out! "
"Anansi"|"Cat Noir"|0.0555521249771118|"Ding, ding, ding, bell's ringin'! Round three. FIGHT! "
"Cat Noir"|"Anansi"|-0.506770074367523|" Huh? Seriously?Oh… uh… M'Lady? I think I got myself into a sticky situation."
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.207356572151184|" Looks like I've already got a catch. You'll be next, beetle."
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.635005086660385|" I don't think so! "
"Anansi"|"Cat Noir"|-0.65524822473526|"You're like a cat caught in a spider's web."
"Cat Noir"|"Anansi"|-0.631847620010376|" Technically speaking, spiders don't actually eat cats."
"Anansi"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.392029345035553|" I suggest we make an exception for you, kitty cat."
"Hawk Moth"|"Nino"|0.385807037353516|"Anansi, grab his Miraculous from him."
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|-0.251872420310974|" Are you okay, dude—uh, I mean, Ladybug?"
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.0494095087051392|" Yeah, but we're gonna need some help! square candle appears) A candle?Of course! But I don't have enough time to do a round trip."
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|0.0245379209518433|" Maybe I could help you?Uh, I get it. It's cool. I'm no superhero. I'd tried to save Alya, but… guess I'm not strong enough."
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|-0.216324090957642|" Let me tell you a secret, uh… "
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|0.0435789823532104|" Nino. The name's Nino."
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.335753977298737|" Nino. When you're facing a supervillain, strength doesn't make a difference. Courage and determination do.We can't let Anansi get Cat Noir's Miraculous. Use this to defend yourself and distract her. I won't be long. "
"Anansi"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.394571483135223|" Where did you hide your earrings, kitty cat?"
"Hawk Moth"|"Anansi"|0.503695845603943|"Anansi, the earrings are Ladybug's Miraculous!Ugh, Cat Noir's magic jewel is a ring!"
"Anansi"|"Nino"|-0.517629832029343|" Why didn't you just say so?"
"Nino"|"Anansi"|-0.149621069431305|" Hey arachnid!"
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|0.0189969539642334|" Ah, so you're back, cappie?"
"Ladybug"|"Marinette"|-0.00975722074508667|"I trust you, Nino. "
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.0250940322875977|"Master, Nino won't hold off Anansi for long. She's about to get a hold of Cat Noir's Miraculous!"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.624267935752869|" We can't let that happen.Marinette Dupain-Cheng, pick an ally you can trust to fight alongside you on this mission. Choose wisely; such power's on hand to serve a greater good. Once the mission is over, you must retrieve the Miraculous from them."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.742731809616089|"I need a protective Miraculous.That's the one I need, Master!Uh, if it's okay with you."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.537834525108337|"Do you have someone in mind, Marinette? "
"Marinette"|"Anansi"|0.615607261657715|"Actually, I think I found just the right person."
"Anansi"|"Cat Noir"|-0.616876244544983|"Wow, be careful. What are you trying to do with that little stick?"
"Cat Noir"|"Anansi"|-0.380772888660431|"On your left; no, on your right. No, the other right!"
"Anansi"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.75652115046978|"You're gonna hurt yourself."
"Hawk Moth"|"Alya"|0.247276306152344|"Anansi, enough toying with your prey. Concentrate on seizing Cat Noir's Miraculous!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.533140927553177|" Nino!"
"Nino"|"Anansi"|0.0973314046859741|" So, who's the fly-weight now, huh?"
"Anansi"|"Nino"|-0.673180609941483|" All right, big boy.I suggest you stay down, cappie.You're gonna regret this, big time!"
"Nino"|"Cat Noir"|-0.647211343050003|" You shouldn't have underestimated me, legs. "
"Cat Noir"|"Alya"|0.662925839424133|"Your friend's good at this."
"Alya"|"Anansi"|-0.483348071575165|" Yeah, but I sure hope Ladybug comes back before he gets bad at it."
"Anansi"|"Nino"|0.236051797866821|"Game over. Time to fly, lightweight! "
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|0.250221014022827|" Thanks, Ladydude—uh, I mean, Ladybug."

"Hawk Moth"|"Anansi"|-0.732226520776749|"No! Don't touch his ring; it's charged with destructive energy!"
"Anansi"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.345887541770935|" Hey, make up your mind, Mothy; I couldn't care less about his Miraculous. You're the one who's been nagging me about it all evening."
"Hawk Moth"|"Anansi"|-0.647469460964203|"Cat Noir has called on his power but he can't use it. Just be patient and wait for him to transform back. Then the ring will be uncharged once again and you'll be able to take it from him."
"Anansi"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0613017678260803|"Whatever, if you say so. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.114716827869415|"Hurry up, Ladybug."
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.048615574836731|"I'm gonna need your help again. Do you still wanna save your friend?"

"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.608821511268616|" Nino Lahiffe,this is the Miraculous of the turtle, which grants the power of protection. You will use it for the greater good."
"Nino"|"Wayzz"|0.125375151634216|"Whoa, dude!"
"Wayzz"|"Nino"|0.655464649200439|" Hello, my name is Wayzz."
"Nino"|"Wayzz"|0.699015021324158|" Hey little guy, what are you, a genie like in those fairy tales?"
"Wayzz"|"Ladybug"|0.313798666000366|" I am a kwami. I can't grant wishes, but I can give you super powers."
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.611329913139343|" Once the job is done, you must return the Miraculous to me. Can I trust you?"
"Nino"|"Wayzz"|0.420650839805603|" You bet, dudette."
"Wayzz"|"Nino"|-0.30810421705246|" Then all you have to say is: \"Wayzz, shell on!\""
"Nino"|"Carapace"|-0.110806405544281|" Wayzz, shell on!"
"Carapace"|"Ladybug"|0.047014594078064|"That's crazy!"
"Ladybug"|"Carapace"|0.215243220329285|" Stay focused! We have to hurry before Cat Noir transforms back. And we need him to save Alya. Lucky Charm! "
"Carapace"|"Ladybug"|-0.492480218410492|" Boxing gloves? You're not gonna fight Anansi directly, are you?"
"Ladybug"|"Carapace"|0.141722440719604|" Why not? It's a simple plan, but you have to protect us — me, Cat Noir and Alya.You've already proved you're capable of doing it."
"Carapace"|"Anansi"|0.450066804885864|" Hey, six-hands! Catch this! "
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.29148930311203|"Change of pet? You replaced your kitty with a turtle?"
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.542372643947601|" I love animals, but I'm not into spiders. Ha! "
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.715717285871506|" Ha! Missed me."
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.335427939891815|" Did I?Anansi! I challenge you. One round. You win, you get my Miraculous. I win, you release your prisoners. What do you have to lose?In a few minutes, Cat Noir will transform back anyway."
"Hawk Moth"|"Anansi"|-0.569586485624313|"Don't listen to her; it's a trap!"
"Anansi"|"Anansi"|-0.666186690330505|" Don't worry, butterfly man, this nasty bug ain't no match for Anansi.I'll devour you, li'l nasty bug."
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|0.238476872444153|" One punch will be enough."
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.640774011611938|"You can't punch the wind. "
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.59176367521286|" It's over. "
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.3477743268013|" One punch, huh? Well, maybe if you could actually land one."
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.777465894818306|" Shut up!"
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.636194467544556|"Why, do you have trouble doing two things at the same time? "
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|0.226264834403992|"Stay still!"
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.671462833881378|"You're so weak that when you're shadow-boxing, your shadow wins!"
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.288665652275085|" Shadow THIS!You can't win this fight, so give up and give me your Miraculous!"

"Hawk Moth"|"Nino"|-0.424509942531586|" You're gaining more allies, Ladybug, but don't rush to rejoice. Soon you might just be outnumbered. "
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.2352215051651|"Hey, you okay? You weren't too scared, were you?"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.548266589641571|" I'm fine. I saw that you tried to save me."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.188013672828674|" Uhm. Actually… no, I didn't do much. It's not like I'm a superhero or anything. "
"Alya"|"Nora"|0.678027868270874|"I know perfectly well what you're like."
"Nora"|"Marinette"|-0.779224410653114|" Fly-weights!Truth is…I did lose the match…and my cool. Sorry about everything that went down."

"Nora"|"Marinette"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?"
"Marinette"|"Nora"|-0.578258663415909|" I helped Nino to win by distracting you. I'm sorry."
"Nora"|"Alya"|-0.0457308292388916|" Hey! We're cool, Marinette.It's no big deal.Cappie proved that he doesn't need muscles to be strong."
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.647557735443115|"Want a scoop? You're the best."
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.54793381690979|" What if Nora came with us to the ice rink next weekend? It'd be more fun with her, don't you think?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.318108260631561|" You're right, Nino. Besides, I don't even remember the last time I hung out with my big sis."

"Trailer"|"Thomas"|0.599827647209167|" Cat Noir and Ladybug: two heroes facing their destiny. Coming soon to theaters."
"Thomas"|"Marinette"|0.524701714515686|" The real Cat Noir and Ladybug won't be able to make it to tonight's premiere, but I hope that they'll love my movie as much as we love them."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.505303084850311|" Meh, I'll be the judge of that."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.552365392446518|" You turned down an invitation to the premiere?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.284074902534485|" I'm a superhero, Tikki, not a star. It's my job to protect the city, not sit around at a movie premiere."
"Tikki"|"Nadja"|0.329421043395996|" Well said, Marinette"
"Nadja"|"Marinette"|0.632955074310303|" The premiere will be attended by many illustrious guests including the rockstar Jagged Stone, the famous fashion designer Gabriel Agreste, and his teen idol son who voiced Cat Noir, Adrien Agreste."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.0105656981468201|"Adrien?! Adrien's gonna be there? Oh no! Ladybug so should have said yes."
"Tikki"|"Tom"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.483413219451904|" So we've got six hundred macarons plus eight hundred petit fours not to mention the Ladybug and Cat Noir tiered cakes."
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.453081607818604|" We should have hired someone to help us serve all these guests at the premiere."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.16698944568634|" Do you mean the premiere for the Ladybug and Cat noir animated movie?"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.299741506576538|" Yes."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.534315466880798|"Me, me, me! I can totally help you out with that. "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.272777080535889|"You mean, as a server?"
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.403466105461121|" Yes. I'll hand the macarons out to Adrien. I mean......to everybody, of course. Not just Adrien 'cause Adrien's not the only one who likes macarons."
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.285908281803131|"And the fact that Adrien is going to be there has nothing with it, of course."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.379870414733887|" Not a thing. Like, not in the slightest. I just want to help out my wonderful sweet parents who I love so much."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.676538407802582|"You guys don't trust me. Then again, I'm such a klutz. Even I wouldn't trust me. "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.17226767539978|" Of course you're not a klutz, my darling. You're hired. We'll just—"
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.649230003356934|"Oh, thank you! You're the best parents in the world! "
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.103682994842529|" We'll just make twice the number of macarons. Just in case."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.731003642082214|" This is going to be such an amazing night! I need something amazing to wear. And last, but definitely not least, the amazing macaron.Ta Da!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.0784673094749451|" Er, don't you think your father's 800 macarons will be plenty?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.549157381057739|" No, Tikki. Adrien deserves a special macaron to show him just how special he is. To me. Just picture it! He's expecting a regular macaron, but I give him this macaroon. He takes one bite and says......oh, Marinette. It's passionfruit, my favorite! How do you know me this well when I'm so secretive? So then I answer, it's because you're so special to me, Adrien. I feel like I've known you forever! So then he says to me—"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.109064817428589|" Wait! Is this why you bake a single macaron every Sunday?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.148025810718536|" Who knows when the perfect opportunity is going to come up? And Adrien cannot have a stale macaron."
"Tikki"|"Nadja"|-0.525363475084305|" Of course not."
"Nadja"|"Doorman"|0.726234674453735|" Don't be bemused, it's just the news. Nadja Chamack coming to you live from the premiere we've all been waiting for: the brand new animated movie of the adventures of Cat Noir and Ladybug. The gorgeous Laura Nightingale, who sang all the songs in the movie, has just arrived!"
"Doorman"|"Doorman"|0.794047236442566|" Good evening, Laura! I'm your biggest fan. "
"Doorman"|"Thomas"|-0.161715686321259|" This is a private event, sir."
"Thomas"|"Doorman"|0.113302111625671|" Huh? Excuse me? I'm Thomas Astruc, the movie director. "
"Doorman"|"Thomas"|0.207327485084534|" You filmed Cat Noir and Ladybug? What are they like in real life?"
"Thomas"|"Doorman"|-0.600227266550064|" Er, it's an animated movie. It's all cartoon characters. We don't actually film anyone. See, there's this whole team that draw the chara—"
"Doorman"|"Tom"|0.300286531448364|" Whatever. Who would want to see Ladybug and Cat Noir as cartoon characters? "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.355743288993835|" So put your thumbs here and look straight ahead."
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|-0.688351988792419|" Uh, shouldn't there be macarons on the tray?"
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.714450597763062|" Yes, yes. We'll put them on as soon as you're ready."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.500061631202698|" Dad, Mom! I am totally ready. Trust me, I'll be super-duper careful."
"Tom"|"Jagged"|0.233063697814941|"Oh, our little girl's spreading her wings."
"Jagged"|"Thomas"|0.734377503395081|" Ladybug is one of my best buds! I can't wait to see her movie!"
"Thomas"|"Jagged"|0.435585141181946|" Well I'm— I'm the director, so actually it's more my movie, so to speak."
"Jagged"|"Thomas"|0.110408067703247|" Oh, so you're the one who created the story?"
"Thomas"|"Jagged"|0.150803565979004|" Well, technically the screen writers wrote the story, inspired by Ladybug's exploits."
"Jagged"|"Thomas"|-0.137076914310455|" Oh, ok. So you did all the drawings?"
"Thomas"|"Jagged"|-0.472750902175903|" No, no. The animators do all the drawings."
"Jagged"|"Thomas"|-0.0987368226051331|" So what do you do then?"
"Thomas"|"Jagged"|-0.0249263048171997|" Well I—"
"Jagged"|"Thomas"|0.641091823577881|" Woah. Hey Marinette! Now she can draw! She does it all herself. Just check out these groovy sunglasses here she made!"
"Thomas"|"Jagged"|0.55144739151001|" Well, that's impressive."
"Jagged"|"Marinette"|0.618563175201416|" She even designed my album cover! "
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.0294973850250244|"Er, thanks. Er, macarons? "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.589520692825317|" Phew. So far so good."
"Sabine"|"Sabine"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.191101670265198|" Uh-oh. She's seen him."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.38580995798111|"Adrien, you're so normal to me. No, special to me. Oh, I'll never get it right."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.586760878562927|" No!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.586760878562927|" No!"
"Chloé"|"Thomas"|0.241576313972473|"You! Go fetch me a chocolate macaron, but make sure it's dark chocolate, not milk chocolate. Got that?"
"Thomas"|"Chloé"|-0.509373068809509|" But I'm not a waiter. I'm the movie director."
"Chloé"|"Thomas"|0.0791382789611816|" Oh, really? So you're the one responsible for this movie?"
"Thomas"|"Chloé"|0.448638796806335|" Yes, yes! Exactly! That's me!"
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.712385147809982|" Then you were the one who left Queen Bee out of the trailer. You're lame, utterly lame. "
"Chloé"|"Thomas"|-0.156554460525513|" And what were you thinking hiring Dupain-Cheng as a waitress?"
"Thomas"|"Chloé"|-0.762578815221786|" I didn't hire her!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.104393362998962|"Actually, it's a really good thing you're doing the serving, Dupain-Cheng, because that means while I'm watching the movie with Adrien, you'll be washing dishes! "
"Marinette"|"Nathalie"|-0.656309098005295|" Excuse me. Sorry! Excuse me. Sorry! Excuse me. "
"Nathalie"|"Marinette"|0.0893939733505249|" Adrien, you're expected to welcome the Tsurugis."
"Marinette"|"Chloé and Marinette in unison"|-0.587292939424515|"Ah! "
"Chloé and Marinette in unison"|"Marinette"|-0.688043981790543|"Oh no! Not her! Huh? Stop it! You're copying me! Quit it! No, you quit it! "
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.611145973205566|" Do you know her?"
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.682922005653381|"I don't just know her, I despise her."
"Chloé"|"Kagami"|-0.309714376926422|"What do you think you're doing sitting next to my Adrikins?That's my seat. "
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.657412469387054|"Don't ever touch me again. Don't ever speak to me again. Don't ever look at me again."
"Adrien"|"Mrs. Tsurugi"|-0.487415969371796|" Kon ban wa Tsurugi-sanDozo yoroshiku onegaishimasu"
"Mrs. Tsurugi"|"Gabriel"|0.697748899459839|" Gabriel-san. Per our discussion at our last meeting, I've brought these documents."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.25822901725769|" Domo arigato, Tsurugi-san. "
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|0.628999710083008|" Please follow me. "
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|0.612024188041687|" I'm glad to see you again, Kagami!"
"Kagami"|"Chloé"|-0.0485082864761353|" Me too, Adrien. "
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.443322896957397|"Okay. We need a plan."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.0303782224655151|" What do you mean, a plan?"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.386680543422699|"A plan! You know, a seat chart of the theater!I don't believe this! Adrien and Kagami are going to be sitting next to each other while I'm two rows behind!? Utterly ridiculous!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.477936863899231|" Yeah, well, I don't even have a seat so—"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.222084045410156|" If we get rid of Kagami before the movie starts, there'll be an extra seat for you."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.65155041217804|" We can't do that!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.568005681037903|" Remember what you said to me once, Marinette? All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people do nothing.Well today, the evil is her and the good people are us!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.0275588631629944|" I'm not too sure about this."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.0765095949172974|" Fine! Keep on not being sure about it and tomorrow, Adrien and Kagami will be on a plane headed for Japan!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.647607415914536|" Adrien? Japan? There's no way!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.0811540484428406|" You think? They're already going to the movies together, their parents are signing papers together. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.626495063304901|"We can't let her do that!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.485058844089508|" Marinette! Surely you're not gonna team up with Chloé?!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.172953724861145|" I'm just stopping Kagami from kidnapping Adrien and taking him off to Japan. He's too nice to see what she's really up to!"
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.221539378166199|" Well I'm more of a dog person... "
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.290762305259705|" Alright.Garbage bag, ladle and what?I asked you to get some rope!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.630054116249084|" All I could find was this cooking string. You know, for tying up roasts."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.432604908943176|" Do I look like someone who knows anything about cooking roasts? "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.0561403036117554|" Hey, wait!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.600208699703217|" Chloé! We can't do this!"
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|0.014269232749939|" Listen, Marinette! If we don't sacrifice a few macarons now Adrien is going to be eating sushi for the rest of his life!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.726709425449371|" You better not screw this up, Dupain-Cheng."
"Marinette"|"Thomas"|0.578547358512878|"I'm doing this for you, Adrien."
"Thomas"|"Children"|0.372877240180969|" Woah!"
"Children"|"Thomas"|-0.349401533603668|" Ladybug! Where's Ladybug?"
"Thomas"|"Teacher"|0.297682166099548|" Hey, kids!"
"Teacher"|"Children"|0.233181357383728|" Ladybug isn't here children. We came here to meet the director of the movie."
"Children"|"Chloé"|-0.289421319961548|" Aw."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.254966378211975|"Hold this for me."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.436612725257874|" Thank you, Adrien! "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.687168002128601|" Here, Adrien. This is, uh, your favorite flavored macaron. Er, of course I'm just guessing. I mean, how would I know, right?But people do sometimes prefer some things to other things so... Here!"
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|-0.1335289478302|" Uh… thanks, Marinette!"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|-0.718839526176453|" What were you doing with that macaron? That was not part of the plan!"
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.738303571939468|" Kagami is something wrong?"
"Kagami"|"Chloé"|0.733683466911316|" These shoes belonged to my grandmother."
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|0.32807719707489|" Hah! This is a part of the plan."
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.217870116233826|" Sit down. I'll help you."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.502513110637665|" Phase two, Dupain-Cheng."
"Marinette"|"Mrs. Tsurugi"|0.617176175117493|" Can you please autograph this for me, Jagged? "
"Mrs. Tsurugi"|"Child"|-0.518932223320007|" Kagami! "
"Child"|"Thomas"|-0.65788322687149|" But if you didn't make the story or the drawings, then you didn't do anything."
"Thomas"|"Children"|-0.389339029788971|" What's happening?"
"Children"|"Thomas"|-0.762886315584183|" Eww!"
"Thomas"|"Tom"|-0.624605774879456|" This macaron contains almonds!I specifically told you that I'm allergic to almonds!"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.548312813043594|" We were so careful about that. All the macarons are made from coconut."
"Marinette"|"Thomas"|-0.470000028610229|" Uh, oh. All but one!"
"Thomas"|"Marinette"|-0.0638545751571655|" What? What in the- Who put this cake on this seat!?"
"Marinette"|"Thomas"|-0.686483949422836|" I should have known! How could one of Chloé's plans end in anything but disaster?"
"Thomas"|"Sabine"|-0.755519732832909|" I spent three years of my life working day in day out for this! What was meant to be my night is ruined! "
"Sabine"|"Thomas"|0.427397966384888|" I'll take those, Tom. "
"Thomas"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.674990773200989|" Oh, nobody could care less about me. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.516586750745773|" Ah! The behind-the-scenes creator who never gets any of the credit. The perfect type of injustice for my akumas.Fly away, creature of the dark and evilize his broken heart!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Thomas"|0.757233023643494|"Animaestro. You're going to show everyone who you really are with a power as limitless as your imagination. All I ask in return are Cat Noir and Ladybug's miraculous."
"Thomas"|"Mrs. Tsurugi"|0.676116228103638|" I want them all to see what a director is capable of! "
"Mrs. Tsurugi"|"Marinette"|0.661439299583435|" Now I understand why Kagami speaks so much about you. Your father has raised you to be a refined young man! "
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.6419358253479|" The plan is a total disaster! Adrien and Kagami are even closer now than they were before."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.769261479377747|" You ruined EVERYTHING, Dupain-Cheng. What was it with that macaron, anyway?"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.522523760795593|" Er. It was a special passion fruit macaron."
"Chloé"|"Doorman"|-0.278181374073029|" But that's the favorite of... No. Don't tell me that!You've got a crush on ADRIEN!That is ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous. You're a nobody in his eyes and you'll always be a nobody. Watch, I'll prove it.Adrikins!"
"Doorman"|"Animaestro"|-0.656676292419434|"Who are you? You can't come- wah!"
"Animaestro"|"Chloé"|-0.277543783187866|" So you really think a director does nothing? Let me show you exactly what I'm capable of."
"Chloé"|"Animaestro"|-0.552448451519012|" Come on! Get a grip! Hey, Adrikins. You'll never guess- "
"Animaestro"|"Animaestro"|-0.667879819869995|" Oh, come on! Don't leave! The show's just getting started!"
"Animaestro"|"Marinette"|-0.45095556974411|" Roar! "
"Marinette"|" Marinette"|-0.543322086334229|" I promise I'll never take Chloé's advice again!"
" Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.203119039535522|" Tikki, spots on! Yeah!"
"Cat Noir"|"Animaestro"|-0.639442890882492|" We'd have come to your movie premiere if we'd have known how upset you were gonna get."

"Max"|"Kim"|0.0440970659255981|" Typical diet for a feline species requiring the strength to run at speeds in excess of 60 miles per hour."
"Kim"|"Otis"|-0.288134694099426|" 60 miles per hour? Is that all? I thought panthers were much faster than that. I bet that I could beat it in a race."
"Otis"|"Kim"|-0.694622904062271|" Impossible. No human being could compete with my panther."
"Kim"|"Otis"|0.0265587568283081|" Is that so? What place did your cat come in at the County Athletics Tournament? I came in first place."
"Otis"|"Kim"|-0.28736025094986|" You can't possibly compare yourself to my panther, kiddo!"

"Kim"|"Max"|0.11953592300415|" Hey, kitty, kitty. How about a little race with me, huh? Last one's a rotten egg!"
"Max"|"Otis"|-0.518641412258148|" Let's see. With a 6 feet-per-second win behind you and 45 degrees to the north-east... I don't think you'd be a rotten egg. You'd be lunch."
"Otis"|"Kim"|-0.726541966199875|" Your friend's right, kiddo. Now please leave. She needs peace and quiet while she eats. You're stressing her out."
"Kim"|"Otis"|-0.718403398990631|" Awww, stressed out, are we, Miss Panthie? You're talking about a wild animal, dude. "
"Otis"|"Kim"|-0.659832090139389|" Leave now! Or I'll have you kicked out of the zoo immediately!"

"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.599433988332748|" Did you say something?"
"Marinette"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.643300622701645|" I said... It'd be so sad if you didn't tell her!"

"Kim"|"Ladybug"|0.31474244594574|" That... panthers are the best?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.380381345748901|" And what do you think about ladybugs?"
"Cat Noir"|"Animan"|0.296741724014282|" And another black cat?"
"Animan"|"Hawk Moth"|0.173544526100159|" I think I'm higher on the food chain."
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|0.265200018882751|" Animan, take their jewels! Their Miraculouses! Bring them to me!"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.0542112588882446|" If you value your life, get out of here! Now!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.423307061195374|" Cat Noir, his bracelet. The akuma must be inside the charm!"
"Cat Noir"|"Animan"|0.32666802406311|" You hold him, I grab the bracelet."
"Animan"|"Cat Noir"|-0.777096107602119|"Attack!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.185516476631165|" We need to put them all back in their cages!"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.565961062908173|" Oh, really? I'm sure they'll do it without putting up a fight!"
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|-0.539448410272598|" I think we'd better split up! "
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.313398241996765|" Hey!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.313398241996765|" Hey!"
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|-0.629641979932785|" What the...?"
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.323273897171021|"Stay here and you'll be safe. "
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|0.257404327392578|"Uhh... Hey, what's up?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.68339478969574|" There are too many of them! We can't capture them all."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.258883893489838|" Well, what are we gonna do then?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.287631213665009|" Back to Plan A. If we can destroy his bracelet, I can capture the akuma. Everything will go back to normal!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.521494388580322|" Sounds like a good idea!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.423480212688446|" But... it's never been broken before!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.652680575847626|" He didn't actually break it. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.583982884883881|" Then how did he get away?"
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.27669233083725|" I don't know, but we better find Kim... I mean, that boy, before he does. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.368683218955994|" Over there!"
"Ladybug"|"Animan"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Animan"|"Ladybug"|-0.160787582397461|" It's down to just the two of us, Kiddo.And then there was one. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.473783850669861|" You're not getting away this time!"
"Cat Noir"|"Animan"|-0.145942330360413|"Quick, go and hide in the first building you come to. "
"Animan"|"Cat Noir"|-0.519348442554474|" You'll never get me! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.525856137275696|" Now we know how we got away earlier."
"Ladybug"|"Kim"|-0.546873688697815|" Where's Kim?Good job, kitty. "
"Kim"|"Tom"|0.12172257900238|" Help! Rescue me! Please!"
"Tom"|"Cat Noir"|-0.376152336597443|" It's okay, son. Come this way. Easy."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.635160028934479|" He's safe inside this building. Panthers can't open doors, so it won't get inside."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.536489307880402|" Panthers can't, but what if he morphs into a smaller animal? Like a mouse, or..."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.0462757349014282|" Right. But we do have an advantage over him. We know exactly where to find his prey."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.243962168693542|" Animan will sniff him out sooner or later, but it's bought us a bit of time to plan our next move."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.694677621126175|" We have to stop Animan before Paris turns into a Jungle."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.605737924575806|" Follow me."
"Ladybug"|"Sabine"|0.027600884437561|" Hi, mo...am."
"Sabine"|"Ladybug"|-0.175533890724182|" Oh, you're... you're, you're Ladybug!"
"Ladybug"|"Nadja"|0.0560400485992432|" Yeah, exactly."
"Nadja"|"Ladybug"|-0.396832048892975|" We interrupt this broadcast with a special report. Animals are invading Paris. The police work harder trying to contain the situation. For your safety, stay in your home and remain calm. Mayor Bourgeois will address the "
"Ladybug"|"Kim"|0.565419912338257|" You'll be safe here. Can I borrow this?"
"Kim"|"Ladybug"|0.554346323013306|" Sure. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.240507006645203|" Come on, Cat Noir. Make sure you lock all the doors and windows."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.2863529920578|" We'll take care of the rest. You won't be in danger."
"Ladybug"|"Tom"|0.49370551109314|" Thanks Da I mean, sir, for all your help."
"Tom"|"Ladybug"|0.0582213401794434|" You're welcome, Ladybug."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.598243832588196|" Et voila."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.205882787704468|" Whoa! What's that stuff?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0838778614997864|" Air freshener! It'll cover up our scent so he can't smell us."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.678954482078552|"Thanks.I've always wanted to smell like... Ocean summer breeze?Couldn't we capture him inside something like this?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.340918838977814|" Only if he transforms into something bigger.Would that make a big enough cage?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.0842664837837219|" Definitely. But how could we get him inside there?He's coming."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.352738261222839|" It's working. He's sniffing out Kim!Follow me."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.450244307518005|" A Ladybug? Smart choice. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.216441988945007|" Couldn't he choose a slower-moving animal?!"
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.754692271351814|" Where's the button for the doors?Of course nothing works! No keys!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|0.441041350364685|" Take his Miraculous... The ring! The ring!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.615858763456345|" All these transformations seem to be tiring him out."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.362568438053131|" Then just let him wear himself out. It'll make it easier to capture his akuma. Cataclysm! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.422343134880066|" It's not exactly a cage, but... it'll do. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.724749237298965|" I don't think he can bear to listen to that noise."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.661911606788635|" You around is too much to bear. Now we wait."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.232904672622681|" Ready to free the akuma?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.420340538024902|" It's working!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.360290765762329|" Hey! Since when do extinct animals count?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.632111430168152|" The T-Rex might have disappeared a long time ago, but technically it's.. still an animal. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.496599972248077|" Well, I know some other animals that will soon be extinct... The cat and the ladybug! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.669832587242126|" Lucky Charm!Huh? A car jack?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.688080132007599|" Too bad Animan doesn't have any flat tires."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.574461072683334|" Look how small his front arms are."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.61295285820961|" So it won't be great at basketball. What are you getting at?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.506364077329636|" You climb on top of him where he can't swipe at you, and while you're distracting him, I'll floor him!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.27212381362915|" Sounds like a good plan. I can be very distracting."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.507984191179276|" Well, that's weird, we didn't have to use this. What does it mean?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.36270546913147|" Well, I guess that only means we rock as a team."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.639948129653931|" Cat Noir, wait!I know what to do. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.674416363239288|" Ladybug!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.689736127853394|" Enjoy your meal! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.29279088973999|" No!You're so gonna pay for this!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.341897010803223|" No more evildoing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug!Pound it? "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.244026482105255|" Ladybug! That was a wild ride.Whoops! Better take my whiskers and run! "
"Ladybug"|"Otis"|0.301077246665955|" See you next time, Cat Noir."
"Otis"|"Ladybug"|-0.656007617712021|" Oh! What happened to me?"
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.590464323759079|" Everything's okay. But you should get back to the zoo and check on your animals."
"Hawk Moth"|"Marinette"|-0.763278365135193|"You ruined everything, Ladybug. This is not how it was supposed to end! But I promise you, one day it will be me at the top of the food chain! And you'll be nothing! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.665715247392654|"Oh no! I forgot all about Alya! She's gonna be so mad at me!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.34939306974411|" And imagine if she knew you're the Ladybug who shut her up in a cage with Nino!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.690220206975937|" Yeah, and she'd actually kill me. Guess I'll take \"mad\", huh.Listen Alya, I'm sorry about earlier. I should have never toldNino I set up a date with you. I just wasn't thinking. But I'll explain everything to him, so don't worry. Promise. Do you forgive me? "
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.223528623580933|" Thanks, Nino."
"Nino"|"Marinette"|0.370316505432129|" Do you want one, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.299487709999084|" Uhh...What's he doing here?"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.662687003612518|" Ladybug locked us up together in the same cage all afternoon."
"Nino"|"Marinette"|0.690120339393616|" It turns out we have lots in common. You know, Marinette, the girl I've got a crush on?"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|0.355815291404724|" Oh, yeah!"
"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.502228409051895|" Actually, it was you."
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.0990959405899048|" Or that's what I thought. But after chilling with Alya that whole time..."
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.422707140445709|"Yeah, well...we don't have to give her all the deets, do we?"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.60141333937645|" Oh, yeah, my bad."
"Alya"|"Alya"|-0.079596996307373|" The funniest part of it was that Nino was being totally coached by Adrien at the zoo!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.481783628463745|" Yup! LOL, huh?"
"Nino"|"Marinette"|0.18136727809906|" Alya tells me you've been crushing on some dude."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.756497800350189|" He doesn't know who it is! Pinky swear! Cause... cause I don't go and make decisions for other people!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.109068632125854|" But if you want, I could totally make it happen!That is, if I knew the dude!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.533140927553177|" Nino!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.324774742126465|" Fine. Pretend I never said anything. But if I...can help."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.533140927553177|" Nino!"
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.747077137231827|"This is rubbish! Ugh, I don't have a thing to wear!This one is way too pink!Those are so last season!Those don't cost nearly as much.And these are never in season! Agh, I hate all of these!Hmm?Is someone there? Anybody? "
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.0421710014343262|" Hey, wait!Come back, shoes! It's not true, I love you!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.0304063558578491|" Whoa, look at Chloé. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.719895094633102|" That girl is a total rag."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.679188340902328|" Maybe she's missing her BFF?"
"Alya"|"Chloé"|-0.610102146863937|" Sabrina have been absent since yesterday, huh? "
"Chloé"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.695945411920547|" Ow!"
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Chloé"|-0.129430055618286|" What is it, Chloé?"
"Chloé"|"Mylène"|-0.651254296302795|" Someone pulled my hair! "
"Mylène"|"Chloé"|-0.679672241210938|" I didn't do it, Ms. M."
"Chloé"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.68604639172554|" It wasn't her, it's-it's some invisible mystical being. Like a leprechaun. Or a unicorn without the horn. "
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Chloé"|-0.704740464687347|" Quiet, everyone! Eyes on your papers!"
"Chloé"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.505044907331467|"Oh, it's happening again. Oh, wah! "
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Chloé"|-0.407979846000671|" Chloé, sit down!"
"Chloé"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.722463399171829|" I can't!My purse is beating me up! "
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.73508295416832|" Chloé, we don't run in the classroom! Get back to your seat!"
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Marinette"|0.346881747245789|" Compose yourself, Miss Bourgeois."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.543287366628647|"Tikki, we got to get out of here."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.23494690656662|" Miss, please, I have to go to the restroom.Thank you. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.690944075584412|" So do I, please?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.0345249772071838|" Somebody seems to have it in for Chloé."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.511784940958023|" Huh, the hard part's gonna be finding out who doesn't."
"Adrien"|"Marinette and Adrien"|-0.555771887302399|" Something really strange going on."
"Marinette and Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.164726614952087|"Time to transform!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.203119039535522|" Tikki, spots on! Yeah! "
"Adrien"|"André"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out! "
"André"|"Cat Noir"|-0.692562460899353|" Damaging my daughter's reputation is the same as soiling the reputation of the Mayor of Paris, umm, which is me. And an attack on Chloé is an attack on Paris."
"Cat Noir"|"André"|-0.262483954429626|" We'll find the culprit, Mr. Bourgeois. You have my word."
"André"|"Chloé"|0.681479573249817|" Chloé, my darling. We got special guests for you."
"Chloé"|"André"|0.37876033782959|"Ladybug!I knew you'd come to save me! You know, considering what good friends we are!"
"André"|"Ladybug"|-0.637863308191299|" I have to put out an emergency call to all the biggest designers. Can you imagine? My daughter wearing department-store clothing? How humiliating."
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.553094476461411|" Have you had any run-ins with anyone lately?"
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.494734346866608|" I never have run-ins with anyone. Everybody absolutely love me."
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.601397186517715|" Really? Not even with your closest friend? "
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|0.741177201271057|" Ah, Sabrina?Impossible. She adores me, I'm her idol!"
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.42172646522522|"Your daughter's safe here with the doors and windows locked. This enemy may be invisible, but it can't go through walls."
"Chloé"|"Cat Noir"|0.493197202682495|"I'm sure you'll make my life perfect again! Just like it was before!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.128895878791809|" Is something up? You seem…"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.597612649202347|" She's hiding something."
"Ladybug"|"Butler Jean"|-0.180789947509766|" Whatever you tell us won't go any farther than this room."
"Butler Jean"|"Butler Jean"|-0.179940700531006|" Mademoiselle did have a run-in with someone."
"Butler Jean"|"Chloé"|0.386259436607361|" Miss Chloé and her friend Sabrina like to impersonate Ladybug and Cat Noir."
"Chloé"|"Butler Jean"|-0.0508841872215271|"Aha! "
"Butler Jean"|"Ladybug"|0.453685164451599|" I was playing the part of Big Mustachio that day. "
"Ladybug"|"Butler Jean"|-0.0908100605010986|" Big Mustachio?"
"Butler Jean"|"Cat Noir"|-0.320297598838806|" One of Mademoiselle's ideas. Big Mustachio want all Parisians to be deface with heinous mustaches."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.735317289829254|" Wow, what a hairy situation. "
"Ladybug"|"Nadja"|0.431057810783386|"Please go on. "
"Nadja"|"Chloé"|0.387914538383484|" Thank you for granting this exclusive interview for your upcoming album, Mr. Stone. Can you tell us how-?"
"Chloé"|"Jagged Stone"|-0.599322617053986|" Jagged Stone!"
"Jagged Stone"|"Chloé"|-0.164994359016418|"Ladybug! What are you doing here?"
"Chloé"|"Jagged Stone"|0.479176878929138|" Um… when I find out you're here, I knew you wanted to see me! I have to come and say hello. "
"Jagged Stone"|"Chloé"|0.236886262893677|" Well, you did the right thing.Hey, what's the dealio with your hair? "
"Chloé"|"Jagged Stone"|-0.348175942897797|" Oh, ah… ha. The old hair was so drab. This color is amazing.Don't you think? I got a few minutes to spare. I'm sure you'd jump at the chance to interview me!"
"Jagged Stone"|"Chloé"|0.281130313873291|" Hey, wait! I thought you're coming by to say hi to me?"
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|0.403700113296509|" And I did! Now where were we?"
"Ladybug"|"Butler Jean"|-0.71014928817749|" She pretended she was me?! How often does that happen?"
"Butler Jean"|"Sabrina"|0.041054368019104|" She idolizes you. "
"Sabrina"|"Jagged Stone"|0.281121850013733|"Chloé, I found Big Mustachio!"
"Jagged Stone"|"Nadja Chamack"|-0.432215869426727|" Chloé? But-"
"Nadja Chamack"|"Chloé"|-0.658859997987747|" You're not Ladybug!You're a fake!"
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.561346590518951|"No, I'm not! I'm Ladybug! Look!"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|-0.245935916900635|" But, Chloé, how was I suppose to know? "
"Chloé"|"Butler Jean"|-0.756507977843285|"That's the problem! You never know anything! Ah, that crocodile has a larger brain than you!Get out! I never want to see you again! "
"Butler Jean"|"Chloé"|-0.455323457717896|" Mademoiselle does argue with her friend Sabrina at times.I'd even go so far to say that it's the norm. But it was different this time. Sabrina came back the next day…"
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.0867912173271179|" Sabrina, who? I don't know any Sabrina."
"Sabrina"|"Butler Jean"|0.195897936820984|" But, of course you do, Chloé. It's me.Your BFF! "
"Butler Jean"|"Chloé"|0.680270075798035|" You should talk to her, Mademoiselle. She's right here."
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.653554826974869|"I don't see anyone, she must be invisible! As far as I'm concerned, she doesn't even exist!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.558793127536774|" This invisible person is obviously Sabrina."
"Cat Noir"|"Chloé"|0.166819334030151|" Who's been akumatized by Hawk Moth."
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.798695728182793|" Impossible!She's too weak to do something so bold, especially to me. You're wrong!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.701659560203552|" You've been a great help to us. Thanks. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.552742630243301|" It's not going to be easy to find someone we can't see. "
"Ladybug"|"Vanisher"|0.347446322441101|" So we'll just have to wait for her to find us. And we do have an advantage, she doesn't know we're onto her. "
"Vanisher"|"Hawk Moth"|0.531570792198181|" And now I do, Ladybug."

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.521773815155029|" I won't bore you with the details, but I'm sure the akumatized object is the brooch with the Chinese ideogram she's wearing. "

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.170241355895996|" Your Lucky Charm seems more convoluted than usual. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.387222409248352|" It's the most complicated ever; I have to stay focused. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.356767416000366|"I'm with you m'lady! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.359440207481384|" Okay, now stretch your arm out like this and take a few steps back until the string is pulled tight.Perfect! Now raise your arm and say \"Cataclysm\" backwards.Msylca... ms-msylca... Msylcatac!"

"Ladybug"|"Backwarder"|-0.675209581851959|" Sorry, we got a little held back, but we're all yours now, no more timeouts! "
"Backwarder"|"Ladybug"|-0.00577294826507568|" My sweet darling Fu, soon we'll be back together again."

"Backwarder"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.75644588470459|" One down! I can't believe Fu chose such a cowardly Ladybug, who would sacrifice her own Cat Noir! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Backwarder"|-0.206335544586182|"What are you doing? Why don't you just take Cat Noir's Miraculous? "
"Backwarder"|"Cat Noir"|-0.506975769996643|" You'll understand soon enough. He's powerless now, but I want Ladybug! She's my only ticket back to Fu. "

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.636981189250946|" Well at least I think so, 'cause to be honest, I still don't understand what all that was about. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0309005975723267|"That's because we girls are mysterious that way. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.696103245019913|"Oh, oops! Sorry, but I'd better scat! Superfast. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.226770579814911|" Why the rush? "
"Cat Noir"|"Ms. Lenoir"|0.00588500499725342|" It's a secret; you see, we cats are mysterious too. "

"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.602551281452179|"I gave you the wrong letter earlier, I hope you'll forgive me. I can't do anything to change the past, but, I hope this letter will change your future. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Train conductor"|0.40203332901001|" Don't believe for one second that you've won, Ladybug! I've acquired more information that will enable me to track the Guardian down. And even though no one in Paris goes by the name of Master Fu, I will find where he's hiding. Soon I'll be able to have him decipher the spellbook for me and maybe, who knows, even get my hands on every Miraculous known on Earth! "
"Train conductor"|"Adrien"|-0.274418830871582|"I know it's taking a long time—"
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.377598285675049|" You seem to be feeling a lot better, Father. "

"Master Fu"|"Ms. Lenoir"|-0.250785946846008|" Marianne, I'm sorry I took so long to come here. I always felt as long as I was in charge of the Miracle Box, I'd be a danger to anyone I'm close to... but that's all in the past now. "
"Ms. Lenoir"|"Master Fu"|0.593691468238831|"I know you always wanted to do what's best. I know what a responsibility it is being the Guardian of the Miraculous. Unfortunately, Hawk Moth now knows that I know you."
"Master Fu"|"Ms. Lenoir"|-0.512987673282623|" Yes, he could hurt you to get to me. "
"Ms. Lenoir"|"Master Fu"|-0.70980766415596|" We can't be together again until he's been defeated. "
"Master Fu"|"Ms. Lenoir"|0.414098739624023|" I have full trust in the ones I have chosen.They will succeed. "

"Marinette"|"Rose"|0.137031674385071|"I'll tell you if I'm still alive after seeing Adrien again tomorrow morning. "

"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.134276509284973|" Well, there's a tunnel under the English Channel, Tikki."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.331536054611206|" Did a superhero do that?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.437043488025665|"No, just regular men with machines."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.485391497612|" I can't believe how many inventions humans have made since I last had an owner."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.473159670829773|" There's no stopping progress, Tikki."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.433617353439331|" There's no stopping you, either. This is gonna be a wonderful sweater!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.420215845108032|" It's a tradition, you know. I always knit my dad a sweater every year for his birthday, so I wanna do something extra special for him this time around, but I couldn't think of anything."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.55613112449646|" I'm sure you'll come up with a perfect idea. You always do."
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|-0.0271760821342468|" I'd better think of it now, 'cause his birthday is today!"
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.463849723339081|" Oh, come on now! It really is a shame, Rolland! It's your son's 40th birthday today!And, uh, I know how much Tom would love it if you-Oh..."
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.617518186569214|" Is that my grandfather again?"
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.299741506576538|" Yes."
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|-0.155677080154419|" So he's definitely not coming, then?"
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.49643075466156|" I did everything I could. It would've made your dad so happy. He doesn't talk very openly about his feelings, but I know he's sad that he doesn't see his own father anymore. It's a shame."
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.709192752838135|" I'd really like to meet him someday, too."
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.584166884422302|" He hasn't left his home or seen a single person for over 20 years!"
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.0136363506317139|" I know, but why not?"
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.689193338155746|" Uh, he's a little old fashioned in his ways. He's not exactly what you call \"modern.\""
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|-0.223296463489532|" But what happened 20 years ago?"
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.305586338043213|" Uh, well, it's complicated. If you really want to know more about it, you should probably ask your dad."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.552789330482483|"Hey, Dad. Why hasn't Grandpa left his house in 20 years?"
"Tom"|"Gina"|0.48249626159668|" Oh? Uh, well, because he's very fond of tradition, and, uh, if you wanna know more about it, you should probably ask Grandma."
"Gina"|"Marinette"|0.452725291252136|" Mmm, oh, he's always lived in the past. Well, it's complicated. If you really want to know about it, you should probably ask your dad or your mom."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.167730450630188|" Oh, okay, thanks Grandma, see you tonight.Seriously, why won't anyone just answer me?! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.35244607925415|" Judging by that look on your face, I'm thinking that you've come up with your idea."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.730642199516296|" You're right, Tikki. I know exactly what I'm getting for my dad for his birthday! I'm gonna get him and his dad back together again! I found Rolland Dupain's address, let's go!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.581196546554565|" What are you waiting for, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.603393167257309|" If I tell him who I am right away, he won't listen to me, just like with mom. "
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.206525087356567|"What do you want?"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.105529546737671|" Uh... I'm... a friend?"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.692885935306549|" I don't have any friends."
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.313924074172974|" This won't be easy. "
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.206525087356567|" What do you want?"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.473144769668579|" Hello, sir. It's the mail lady."
"Rolland"|"Rolland"|-0.472656965255737|" Do what you usually do. Throw the mail in the trash. "
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.206525087356567|" What do you want?"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.183448553085327|" It's for the firefighter's calendar?"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.756871894001961|" Ah, doesn't need the fire. I hate calenders!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.73375204205513|" There's no use, it's hopeless. "
"Tikki"|"Rolland"|-0.737735658884048|" Come on, that's not the Marinette I know, giving up so easily."
"Rolland"|"Gilbert"|0.206525087356567|" What do you want?"
"Gilbert"|"Rolland"|0.325983047485352|" Your flour's here, Mr. Dupain!"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.452925324440002|" Oh! Come in, come in! The door's open. "
"Marinette"|"Gilbert"|0.33505380153656|"Hello! I'm Marinette, Mr. Dupain's granddaughter! I was just about to go in, myself. You can leave me the sack, I'll bring it to him. It'll be a nice surprise."
"Gilbert"|"Marinette"|0.400203347206116|" Rolland has a granddaughter?"
"Marinette"|"Gilbert"|0.702076077461243|" He sure does! "
"Gilbert"|"Marinette"|0.377944946289062|" I should probably help you..."
"Marinette"|"Gilbert"|-0.208904504776001|" Oh no! It's... light. Could I borrow your cap? I wanna play a prank on Grandpa."
"Gilbert"|"Tikki"|0.620109796524048|"Say hi to Rolland for me! I'll grab my cap next time I come by! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.39150595664978|" You sure you should be sneaking in, lying, and pretending to be someone else? You've never met your grandfather, you don't know how he'll react!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.262950241565704|" Well, it's not exactly a lie. After all, I am actually-Delivering the! All the uh!The flour! What really matters is that he comes to dad's birthday party, and that they both make up.Hide, Tikki! "
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.390344202518463|"Put the sack down in the usual place, Gilbert! "
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.402854323387146|"Oh! Uh, where's his usual place?"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.617599964141846|"You're not Gilbert!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.446200370788574|" No... I'm, um, Germaine! His cousin!"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.555166214704514|" Hmm. Aren't you a little young to be delivering flour?"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.687870740890503|" I'm... an intern!I'm doing a flour delivery internship, because some day I wanna own my own flour shop!"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.448872447013855|"It's good to be ambitious. You can put the sack down now. Have a nice day.Soot! "
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.205417633056641|" So you're a baker then, huh?"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.126067936420441|" Are you a flour delivery girl or a nosy detective? Go on! Put the bag down and be on your way!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.370329618453979|" That oven you have there, it's a '72 La Pegnole, Right? It's a rare woodfired model! They only made a few hundred of them! "
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.32801353931427|"How did you know that?"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.265647649765015|" My daddy- uh, um- My bready, bread history teacher taught us that."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.461180210113525|" Well, that's new.You need bread history classes to become a flour delivery person now?"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.387388706207275|" You bet! You have to study for ten years to be a delivery person these days!"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.343853712081909|"Good luck with your internship, Germaine. Now put the sack down and have a good day!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.133479356765747|"That's a weird looking computer you got there."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.493522822856903|"A computer? In my house? Are you insane? That's a TV!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.366974711418152|" Really, but... is it still working? "
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.734815925359726|" Nope. Turned it on one day and poof!Stopped working."
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.691656082868576|" It probably doesn't meet cable standards anymore. We just watch everything on the Internet now."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.534243285655975|" The Internet is just as crazy as cordless telephones! That's not how it's done!How can sound with pictures go through, if there aren't any wires?"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.759755373001099|" Simple!They're sent in wave form to relay antennas, which are connected to satellites. It's awesome! You can talk, and see anyone you want, anywhere in the world."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.680345088243484|"I don't need to speak to anyone! And besides, that's not how it's done if you want to talk to someone! Now put the sack down, and leave me alone! I've got work to do!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.161123275756836|"Do you live alone? Do you have any family?"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.752996742725372|"Hapa papapa! You really are a noisy detective. Don't touch a thing, put the sack down, and leave. "
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.489645004272461|"Oh! Nice bread dough! "
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.67340874671936|" Wait, no! Don't touch that! That's not how it's- !"
"Marinette"|"Rolland and Marinette"|0.0246845483779907|" Don't worry, I know how it's done.You take the dough and fold it in half, rhythmically, pressing it flat..."
"Rolland and Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.643832594156265|" ...snapping it slightly- oh! Huh? "
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.492071866989136|" It gives it elasticity and develops the gluten in the dough, so that it holds together well after it's been baked."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.549801558256149|"Tch! You're just a school girl reciting a lesson. You don't really know how it's done."
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.688851356506348|" I do know my stuff. Maybe even better that you, old man."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.0397007465362549|" Better than me? Better than me?Better than me!?Charlotte, Marie-Louise, Marguerite-do you hear that?Better than me!?We'll see about that.Get into position. Germaine! We're going to make some bread together! Then we'll see who's the baker, and who's only good for delivering flour!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.592195719480515|"Mm hmm."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.538117051124573|" See this yeast? It's been grown for over two-thousand years by my family, ever since my indomitable ancestor, Loafamix the Gaul. We used to make bread in a small Armorican village, fell alongside Vercingétorix. To be precise, he was my great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-Great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.709607809782028|" Phew..."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.755347922444344|" But the Romans won. Poof!And started putting vegetables and cheese on their bread!Lulu lululu! And now it's pizza!Bleh, bleh, bleh bleh bleh!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.559267044067383|" I like pizza!"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.202339291572571|" You like pizza? You, Germaine, like pizza?!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.474929571151733|" Yes, I do."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.414564728736877|"Oh! She likes pizza! Oh! But that's not how it's done! You don't put cheese and tomatoes on bread dough! It's just like my son, and his wife, who got it into their heads that adding rice to the dough, would make the inside of the bread lighter! That's not how it's done!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.0527632236480713|" But what if it's really yummy? Have you ever tried your son's bread?"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.687185108661652|"Tata, tatata! No need, I already know it's not going to be good. Making bread with rice flour. That's. Not. How. It's. Done!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.599491715431213|" Well, I think it's creative."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.0891557335853577|"How? "
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.345054984092712|" So, your son's a baker, then?"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.743416637182236|" I don't have a son anymore. Not since he betrayed me."
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.474108576774597|" What, just because he put rice in the bread dough?"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.498863339424133|"That's. Not. How. It's. Done."
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.387669205665588|"If my bread comes out tasting as good as yours, will you agree to do just one thing for me?"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.329312384128571|" Why? What do you want me to do?"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.266583323478699|" Are you a baker, or a nosy detective?"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.612547606229782|" Ha! Your bread won't be as good as mine anyway. "
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.152502179145813|"La la, lala lala, lalala."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.596263319253922|" That song... that's the song my son and I used to sing when we were... kneading... dough! There's no way you could know that song. Un- Unless- Unless you're- But no, that- that's impossible!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.597554206848145|"Yes, I'm your granddaughter, Marinette."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.53736075758934|" You're... my granddaughter?Liar! I don't have a granddaughter! Betrayal! Deceit! It's just like adding new ingredients to bread! Deceptive! That's not how it's done!Shoo! Get out! Get out! Out with the liar!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.659803777933121|" No! I'm not leaving, not until you've tasted my bread. You promised you would."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.239678740501404|" Hoh! You want to stay here? Stay here then! "
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.462476670742035|"Whether you like it or not, you are my grandfather! And today's your son's birthday, don't you want to see him again?"
"Rolland"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.779791116714478|"La la la, I can't hear anything! La la, lala la!Don't look at me like that. She shouldn't have lied to her grandfather. I mean, to her not grandfather.And her bread. I bet her bread is as terrible as her father's. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Rolland"|0.433281898498535|" Hmm. I can smell the bread that's being baked with flames of fury. A perfect recipe for my Akumas.Fly away, my little Akuma, and evillize him! "
"Rolland"|"Hawk Moth"|0.136926531791687|"That's not how it's done by the Dupain, the proud descendants of 'Loafamix the Gaul.' "
"Hawk Moth"|"Rolland"|0.330726742744446|"Bakerix, I am Hawk Moth, and I see that you're hungry for power. Well I'm giving you the ability to serve punishments to anyone who doesn't do things like they should be done!"
"Rolland"|"Hawk Moth"|0.677421450614929|"Of course! Would you like a butter croissant or a baguette to go with that?"
"Hawk Moth"|"Rolland"|-0.221606075763702|"No! In return I want the Miraculous of Ladybug and Cat Noir, two offenders who don't know how it's done. So show me."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.640264987945557|"You can count on me, Hawk Moth. ."
"Marinette"|"Bakerix"|-0.303364813327789|"Grandpa! "
"Bakerix"|"Marinette"|-0.700138688087463|"There is no grandpa. I am Bakerix, and anyone who doesn't do things the way they should be done, will be served my indomitable wrath! Soon, Paris will look like it did before the modern world took over! "
"Marinette"|"Bakerix"|-0.56609371304512|" No! Grandpa! "
"Bakerix"|"Marinette"|-0.127271413803101|"Yah! "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.519299745559692|" We'll finish the baking later! "
"Marinette"|"Bakerix"|-0.203119039535522|" Tikki, spots on! Yeah!"
"Bakerix"|"Bus Driver"|-0.655893504619598|"Huh? Why isn't this bus making any noise?"
"Bus Driver"|"Bakerix"|-0.33920955657959|"Well, because it's a modern bus, it runs on electricity."
"Bakerix"|"Ladybug"|-0.619660586118698|" An electric bus? That's not how it's done! Buses make noise! They run on gas and spew out stinky, black smoke!Away with modern buses!What's all this? There's a flying superman girl in Paris now?"
"Ladybug"|"Bakerix"|0.596205949783325|" Yup! Girl, and superhero. You gotta get with the times."
"Bakerix"|"Ladybug"|-0.286969661712646|" That's not how it's done! It's up to the police or the army to carry out law enforcement! Not you!Ah!"
"Ladybug"|"Nadja"|-0.587292939424515|" Ah!"
"Nadja"|"Bakerix"|-0.64599472284317|" Just minutes before the unveiling of the ultra-modern Startrain, I've been told that a super-Gaul is wreaking havoc right here in Paris. "
"Bakerix"|"Ladybug"|-0.535306721925735|"I'm going to rid Paris of all this modern nonsense, starting with you! "
"Ladybug"|"Bakerix"|0.130746006965637|" Well technically, I'm not actually all that modern.My Miraculous is from ancient times!"
"Bakerix"|"Adrien"|-0.630560725927353|" Well, we didn't have superheroes in my youth!There will be no superheroes in my Paris! "
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.538556694984436|" Looks like Ladybug's the one unveiling a brand new method of air transport."
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.74392181634903|"Ah! Oof!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.665731072425842|" Don't worry, milady,I'm right here."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.386954486370087|"Thanks Cat Noir, but girls don't always need to be saved by a boy."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.357609033584595|" You think I'm a tad old-fashioned, don't you?"
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|-0.731143057346344|" Oh, I've seen worse than you. Just wait 'til you meet Bakerix. "
"Nino"|"André"|0.400077104568481|"Thanks, André."
"André"|"Bakerix"|-0.587292939424515|"Ah! "
"Bakerix"|"Alya"|0.0587928295135498|"What are you doing?"
"Alya"|"Bakerix"|-0.372492253780365|" Uh, I'm filming you?"
"Bakerix"|"Alya"|-0.677625209093094|" Ah! Telephones are for telephoning! Not for filming!That is not how it's done!"
"Alya"|"Bakerix"|-0.637622147798538|" Hey! That's censorship!"
"Bakerix"|"Cat Noir"|0.0596206188201904|" Just like the good ol' days.Oh! Oh hoho! An Egyptian pyramid in the King's court!But that's not how it's done! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.676450848579407|" A blending of ancient and modern. I personally like this glass pyramid a lot."
"Ladybug"|"Bakerix"|0.755872845649719|" It's proof that you can be modern, and still respect the past."
"Bakerix"|"Cat Noir"|-0.795335009694099|"Treachery! Treason! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.124792158603668|" I think we better destroy that flask of his."
"Ladybug"|"Bakerix"|0.0357317924499512|" You're right, it's probably where the Akuma is, too. Ah! "
"Bakerix"|"Cat Noir"|-0.600901931524277|" You're out of your league! You don't have enough experience! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.815311551094055|" Trapped! Cata- !"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.623205274343491|"Save your Cataclysm! We're probably gonna need it.Emergency exit!"
"Cat Noir"|"Bakerix"|0.52965247631073|" Good eye. "
"Bakerix"|"Bakerix"|-0.470346450805664|" What the- ! A train that goes underwater? Is it a train or a submarine? That's not how it's done! If you want to go to England,you take a boat!You get sea sick!Ah! "
"Bakerix"|"Ladybug"|-0.735162615776062|" Ladies and gentlemen, I've got bad news for you. This train is out of service! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0231282711029053|" We've got a train to catch. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.465439677238464|" Boarding now! "
"Ladybug"|"Bakerix"|0.522554516792297|"Be reasonable now, Mister Bakerix. There are a lot of people on this train."
"Bakerix"|"Cat Noir"|-0.605655521154404|" Well then they better get off, because it's on it's way to the wrecking yard! "
"Cat Noir"|"Chloé"|0.438189029693604|"Go on!"
"Chloé"|"Cat Noir"|0.18863844871521|"You should ask Queen Bee for some help."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.0437957048416138|"We're doing okay for now, but I'll remember that. Thanks, Chloé. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.179165959358215|" Whoa!Not again!Lucky Charm! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.147633194923401|" Tomatoes in a bottle? Mmm, I doubt our friend will take too kindly to this."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.211493730545044|" That's what I'm counting on.In fact, I'm planning to give our baker friend the least traditional sandwich possible. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.471351742744446|" Got it! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.214474558830261|"How about some super sour candy chews, plus some super chemical chewing gum, all packed between two slices of white industrial bread."

"Cat Noir"|"Rolland"|0.481229186058044|" Well, if it's all good, I'll be on my way. "
"Rolland"|"Cat Noir"|0.338260173797607|" No, wait! We need a judge, to determine which of these loaves is the best."
"Cat Noir"|"Rolland and Marinette"|0.327216625213623|"Uh, the thing is, I'm gonna transform back soon, and- whoa!You're a real tough cookie, even without your superpowers.Mmm. Both these breads are delicious, d'you have any jam by any chance?"

"Cat Noir"|"Rolland"|0.0809299945831299|" They're both tasty, in different ways. This one's more traditional, and this one has a delicate flavor that makes it special. It's too hard to choose.I'm sorry but I really do have to get going.Thanks for the tasty snack! "
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.813076615333557|"Mmm, he's right! This flavor is... is really good!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.602717638015747|" I did it the way my dad does it!"

"Rolland"|"Tom"|0.341666221618652|"You're not a traditional granddaughter, Marinette. But you know what?I like it."
"Tom"|"Sabine"|-0.231521546840668|"Baba, ba bumbum, baba bum bum..."
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.0765039324760437|"Rolland? "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.674937844276428|" Happy birthday, Dad. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.69286584854126|" Marinette, this is quite a special day for you!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.56993505358696|" Yes, Tikki! It sure is. Hm, still no call..."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.683749794960022|" There's a ritual we kwamis perform on a day like this."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.729873657226562|"Oh really? That's nice."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.501998752355576|" But I don't know if you humans would like it. I wonder if you guys even give each other presents on your birthday."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.274396300315857|"Oh really, Tikki? You got me a birthday present?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.343786716461182|" A kwami specialty."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.656167030334473|" Oh, that so awesome! What is it?"
"Tikki"|"Tikki"|0.721166253089905|"Miraculous birthday, Marinette!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.701422989368439|"Oh no, you don't like it, do you?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.735818266868591|" Yes! Yes, I love it! It's amazing. It's a, uhhh, what is it?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.569969534873962|" A Kwagatama. A great symbol of friendship among us kwamis. We take a hair from our Miraculous holder and join it to the hairs of all the former Miraculous holders. And with them we grow a magic resin for a few months and-I know you don't wanna tell me because you don't want to hurt my feelings but it's obvious you don't like it."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.630083292722702|" I'm sorry, Tikki! I-I really love your gift. It's just that Alya should already have called me by now. We're supposed to be taking her little sister to the\"dentist\"at four o'clock today."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.178566098213196|"Do you humans always celebrate your birthday by going to the dentist?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.596924126148224|" No, of course not, Tikki. It's a secret code! They're actually throwing me a surprise birthday party!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.139863610267639|" But how can it be a surprise if you know about it?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.103593111038208|" The thing about surprises is you know about it but pretend you don't so you won't spoil it for the people who are organising it!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.260688006877899|" What about the dentist?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.285486698150635|" It's a fake-out! See, Alya's gonna pretend to take me to the dentist, but she'll really be taking me to my surprise party!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.653137058019638|" What if you're wrong?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.727423369884491|" Impossible. All the signs are there, Tikki.Juleka totally jumped when I caught her holding a bicycle pump. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.0968049764633179|" Perhaps Juleka has a bicycle!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.308346092700958|" No, Tikki! Obviously she was planning to use the pump to blow up balloons! A surprise birthday party always has balloons! Also, yesterdayI caught Nino listening to my favourite song! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.743904709815979|" Perhaps it's his favorite song, too!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.575349122285843|" Are you kidding? He hates it! He has no reason to listen to it unless... He's making a playlist for my surprise party! Elementary."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.157880008220673|" Okay. Why was Alya having a secret convo with Adrien, huh?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.35109281539917|"Uh, uh... yes, Alya! I know a very good dentist and here's his number!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.662134885787964|" Which means... He's going to be there!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.162046730518341|" Or it means Alya is taking her sisters to see Adrien's dentist!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.216173112392426|" Fine, you know what? There's one no-fail way to find out if there's a surprise party in the making."
"Marinette"|" Tom"|0.531544089317322|"Watch their faces.Mom! Dad! Do you know anything about Alya planning a surprise party for my birthday?"
" Tom"|" Sabine"|-0.0828102827072144|" Uh, oh, uh... Party? Uh, what party? Uh, which Alya, again?"
" Sabine"|"Tom"|-0.738653719425201|"You're overdoing it... we're talking about her best friend!"
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.0234320163726807|" Alya! Of course, Alya! We haven't seen her in years! "
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.408792495727539|"See? Parents always know when there's a surprise party in the works."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.550354838371277|" And now, on the other side of this door, check out who's coming to get me! Just in time for the party! It's-Grandma?!"
"Tom"|"Sabine"|-0.416328847408295|"Mom?"
"Sabine"|"Gina"|-0.403599560260773|"Gina?"
"Gina"|"Marinette"|0.306406378746033|"Marinetta! You're so tall for your age! Did you get my letter from Patagonia?"
"Marinette"|"Gina"|-0.527621984481812|" Yes! And the ones from Australia, Bali, and Estonia, too! Did you really get chased by a bear?!"
"Gina"|"Tom"|-0.513035356998444|"Yes. But we wound up good friends in the end. "
"Tom"|"Gina"|0.0679830312728882|"Mom. It's her birthday, remember?"
"Gina"|"Tom"|-0.205441534519196|" Why do you think I'm here?Happy birthday, my little fairy! My Inuit friend knitted it especially for your tenth birthday!"
"Tom"|"Gina"|-0.569509953260422|"Uh, she's fourteen."
"Gina"|"Marinette"|0.543420076370239|"My. How time flies.That's okay. I'll ask my friend to make another one."
"Marinette"|"Gina"|-0.0222411155700684|" No! No, it's awesome! I can make this work. It's perfect, grandma. Thank you."
"Gina"|"Marinette"|0.560430288314819|" Your Nonna has also brought you your favourite candy! "
"Marinette"|"Gina"|-0.168679296970367|" Oh! "
"Gina"|"Marinette"|0.349112510681152|" You still love them, right?"
"Marinette"|"Gina"|0.461280107498169|" Yes, yes of course..."
"Gina"|"Tom"|0.558435678482056|" And that's not all, my fairy! We'll have a wonderful day, you and I! Just like the last time. Well go to the merry-go-round and to the zoo, then-!"
"Tom"|"Gina"|-0.288079738616943|" Uh, mom? Can I have a word, mom? Uh, just the two of us."
"Gina"|"Tom"|-0.202273547649384|" What, Tom? That I don't know my Marinetta anymore because I'm always travelling?"
"Tom"|"Gina"|-0.678612947463989|" No, mom! It's just-"
"Gina"|"Marinette"|-0.717520833015442|" You think she doesn't want to spend time with her Nonna, is that it?"
"Marinette"|"Gina"|-0.539089918136597|" No! Of course I want to spend time with you! Uh, besides, it's not four o'clock yet."
"Gina"|"Marinette"|0.394380688667297|" There. You see? Come on, let's go, Marinetta! We're going to have a ball! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.715815126895905|" It's four o'clock. Maybe you were right. I jumped to conclusions, and there really is no surprise party. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.66898649930954|" How come you don't tell your grandmother you don't like this candy?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.709276646375656|" I don't want to hurt her feelings. We don't get to see each other very often.Alya!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.364207088947296|" Sorry, I'm running late. Can you meet me at the park? We'll, uh- -jam straight from there to the uh, dentist!"
"Marinette"|"Gina"|0.0741245746612549|" Yes, uh, yes! Awesome! To the dentist! Totally!I'll be right there!Oh! Uh- I'm so sorry, Grandma. I have to go to the dentist with Alya-"
"Gina"|"Marinette"|-0.689428627490997|" Surely you're not going to the dentist on your birthday? I still have to take you to see the trains at Gare de Lyon Station!"
"Marinette"|"Gina"|0.235199928283691|" Well, it's because Alya actually has sisters who are twins and well, because there are two of them, Alya needs my help.Wait what am I saying?That's all a fake-out. You know what I think, Grandma, is that Alya might be throwing me a surprise birthday party-"
"Gina"|"Marinette"|0.228862047195435|"I get it, my fairy. Don't worry about me. Run along now and go meet your friend."
"Marinette"|"Gina"|-0.197651505470276|" Are you sure?"
"Gina"|"Marinette"|0.714499354362488|" Go on. I'll hold on to all of this. We'll catch up with each other later."
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.698697447776794|"Oh, thank you!You really are the best grandma in the world!"
"Sabine"|"Sabine"|-0.451049208641052|" Tom, that's the motorcycle! They're coming back! Marinette can't see the cake!"
"Sabine"|"Gina"|-0.631569772958755|"Uh, where's Marinette?"
"Gina"|"Sabine"|-0.447231113910675|" Tom was right. She's too old now to spend time with her Nonna..."
"Sabine"|"Gina"|-0.496213436126709|" What? No, no! Tom never said that."
"Gina"|"Sabine"|-0.00259202718734741|" That's sweet of you, Sabine. But it's not a big deal. That's life. I'll be up in the apartment if you need me. "
"Sabine"|"Tom"|-0.56429198384285|"You should go and speak to your mother, she's u-Oh no!"
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.500789165496826|" I know, and it's almost time for the party!"
"Sabine"|"Hawk Moth"|0.675709247589111|" Okay, I can help you. We can manage, and we'll take Gina to the party with us! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Hawk Moth"|0.0787379741668701|" What could be more powerful than a grandmother deserted by her own granddaughter? Perfect fodder for disappointment and misunderstanding!Fly away, my little akuma and evilize her ailing heart!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Gina"|0.343176364898682|" Befana, I am Hawk Moth. I'm restoring your matriarchal power as grandmother. You will use these candies to reward the deserving and punish the ungrateful. As for my reward, you will bring me theMiraculous of those pesky little kids, Ladybug and Cat Noir!"
"Gina"|"Sabine"|-0.488444626331329|" You're right, Hawk Moth. The time has come to teach them all a lesson. "
"Sabine"|"Tom"|0.44848895072937|" Tada!"
"Tom"|"Sabine"|-0.314682722091675|" Ha!"
"Sabine"|"Tom"|0.709290862083435|"Good job, partner! We'd better get going, the party awaits us!"
"Tom"|"Befana"|-0.119116127490997|" Oh, wait, we've gotta tell mom."
"Befana"|"Tom"|-0.557887643575668|" Not this time. Don't tell your mama what to do."
"Tom"|"Befana"|-0.416328847408295|" Mom-! "
"Befana"|"Sabine"|-0.220878481864929|"Do you know what naughty boys get?Coal!You have nothing to fear, my fairy.You've always been good to me.So, now tell me. Marinetta isn't at the dentist, is she?"
"Sabine"|"Befana"|-0.552901476621628|" No, mistress."
"Befana"|"Adrien"|0.592575550079346|" Then take me to her!"
"Adrien"|"Alya"|0.661232590675354|" Happy birthday, Marinette."
"Alya"|"Befana"|0.106184244155884|" Open it, Marinette!"
"Befana"|"Marinette"|0.11599600315094|"La Befana comes at night, on her shaky broom in flight. She gives candy to those who are dandy."
"Marinette"|"Befana"|-0.233511209487915|" Grandma!?"
"Befana"|"Marinette"|-0.53875669836998|" You lied to your grandma, Marinetta."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.430450022220612|" No, I- I didn't know Alya was throwing a surprise party for me."
"Alya"|"Befana"|0.683943390846252|"She's for real, ma'am."
"Befana"|"Marinette"|-0.157799541950226|" And all those candies you pretended to be eating?"
"Marinette"|"Befana"|-0.775275200605392|" I'm sorry, grandma. It's just that I didn't want to upset you."
"Befana"|"Marinette"|-0.616854757070541|" I'm not your grandma anymore. From now on, I am only Befana! And I'm going to punish you for all those lies! "
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.586760878562927|" No!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.744587481021881|" We didn't even get in on the buffet!"
"Adrien"|" Adrien"|-0.50868421792984|" Party's over, my friend!"
" Adrien"|"Befana"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Befana"|"Cat Noir"|-0.725471258163452|" It's rude to leave while Befana's still speaking to you. "
"Cat Noir"|"Befana"|-0.408854246139526|"Hey, I never knew grandmas could be so nasty."
"Befana"|"Cat Noir"|0.494978427886963|" You would look wonderful in white, my pretty kitty. "
"Cat Noir"|"Befana"|-0.446425497531891|" Eh, not convinced. I'm much more into black- makes my eyes stand out, don't you think? "
"Befana"|"Cat Noir"|0.118489027023315|"Take care of this pesky pussycat!"
"Cat Noir"|"Befana"|-0.601752430200577|" Hey, I thought fairies were supposed to be nice! "
"Befana"|"Marinette"|-0.799881279468536|"You're not getting away unpunished, Marinetta!You don't deserve all these presents, you spoiled little brat! Now, for what you really deserve.Don't worry. You'll get what's coming to you."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.094995379447937|"This isn't how I envisioned my birthday party..."
"Tikki"|"Befana"|-0.165358126163483|"You need to transform!"
"Befana"|"Marinette"|-0.592820972204208|" Do you lie only to me?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.624045819044113|" Cat Noir!"

"Befana"|"Alya"|-0.121458113193512|"Or do you also lie to your parents and your friends, too?"
"Alya"|"Befana"|-0.0712155699729919|"We gotta help Marinette!"
"Befana"|"Alya"|-0.192695736885071|" The time has come to teach you a lesson. "
"Alya"|"Befana"|-0.627688646316528|" Marinette is not a liar!"
"Befana"|"Marinette"|0.144967675209045|" Someone has to teach you table manners! "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.557039171457291|" Alya!"
"Marinette"|"Befana"|-0.588847905397415|" No, Kim!"
"Befana"|"Rose"|-0.678889632225037|" That's what you get for stealing candy, you bunch of ill-mannered kids!"
"Rose"|"Befana"|-0.602117478847504|" Don't touch Marinette! She's only the nicest person in the world!"
"Befana"|"Marinette"|-0.672112673521042|" That's very disrespectful, to speak up without permission! But then again, it's quite noble of you to stick up for your friends. Okay. I shall make you a fairy.You are going to help me discipline your friend. "
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.467220723628998|" Tikki-"
"Cat Noir"|"Befana"|-0.706015288829803|" Sorry I kept you waiting. We need to find you a better hiding placeShall we? "
"Befana"|"Juleka"|-0.619442373514175|" Marinetta is getting away with the kitty! Catch them!"

"Max"|"Befana"|-0.637713193893433|"We won't let you hurt Marinette!"
"Befana"|"Cat Noir"|-0.237308144569397|" Is that how you speak to your elders? How rude.Maybe this way you'll learn to keep quiet."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.237659156322479|" You must be a real cool girl if your friends are protecting you like that. So why's your grandma flipping out?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.28956127166748|" I think she wanted me to spend more time with her."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.587817490100861|" Don't worry. I promise to get your real grandma back safe.Oh, I almost forgot. Happy birthday, anyway."

"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.757001042366028|" I always carry the lucky charm you gave me with me wherever I go, and I think it works pretty well. So... I figured it was my turn to make one for you."

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.448810696601868|"Yeah, well, it's kind of a weird gift if you ask me."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.305358290672302|"Heh, no weirder than yours, Tikki. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.501745849847794|" But that doesn't mean they're not both precious to me."

"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.298177719116211|" No worries girl. The gig hasn't started yet."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.502329885959625|" What if he doesn't know Juleka's address? Or he got the wrong day? Or he's lost? Could you check with Nino please? You know, of course, just... casually."
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.194937586784363|" Hey, Nino, did you hear from Adrien, by any chance?"
"Nino"|"Anarka"|-0.234520673751831|" He had something to do with his old man. He said he'll come right after. "
"Anarka"|"Marinette"|0.765331149101257|" Captain Anarka speaking to ya'! So how's it comin' along me young pirates? Ready to celebrate the-Whatcha up to, there, matey?"
"Marinette"|"Anarka"|0.409574866294861|" Uh, hello ma'am. I'm cleaning up for tonight! Your boat's gonna be clean as a whistle!"
"Anarka"|"Gabriel"|-0.725270718336105|" You're cleaning?We never pick up in this house! Didn't me daughter tell you? We like the lived-in look. We have no rules on The Liberty! Out of chaos comes creation! Messiness is life!"
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.0607250928878784|" I've heard enough. Are you sure you're practicing, Adrien?"
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.451044917106628|" I'm just doing the same exercises over and over again. I think I could make better progress if I could just play with other musicians. After all, music's meant to be shared with other people, don't you think? "
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.29543000459671|" We Agrestes are soloists. We're no where group members. I suggest you rehearse your piece some more. You'll play it for me again later today."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.395295679569244|" But father, you promised that I could attend my friends' concert."
"Gabriel"|"Nino"|-0.669863432645798|" Not after that performance you've just given, which is probably due to their influence! You need to refocus, Adrien. "
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.566565245389938|"Wassup dude?...Wow, what happened?...Whoa, that's real rough. Good luck dude, see you tomorrow!"
"Alya"|"Anarka"|-0.572340041399002|" Well it's not exactly the first time his dad's kept him from hanging out with us. Actually, I'd have been super surprised if he hadn't."
"Anarka"|"Marinette"|-0.71963819861412|" Whoa, sailor! Never place a metal object next to a compass, ya hear lass? Metal attracts the needle, just like a magnet, which is why you cant get them anywhere near each other."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.666325062513351|" I know how they feel. Maybe I'm just like this statue and Adrien's my compass. Maybe we're meant to stay away from each other forever."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.257502973079681|" I think its the other way around. He's the statue and your the compass that goes crazy whenever he gets close! There'll be other chances, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Rose"|-0.12351381778717|" That's what you said last time, and the time before that."
"Rose"|"Anarka"|-0.604470074176788|" We're ready Captain! Uh... but Luka's missing."
"Anarka"|"Marinette"|0.0675790309906006|" Marinette, right?"
"Marinette"|"Anarka"|0.529710531234741|" Yes, ma'am... uh, Captain!"
"Anarka"|"Marinette"|-0.0798637270927429|" Since you're free from your cleaning duties, could you go and tell Luka that we're waiting for him to start rehearsals?"
"Marinette"|"Anarka"|-0.182071805000305|" Of course. Uh, but who's Luka? And where is he?"
"Anarka"|"Marinette"|0.377472043037415|" Luka's my son, you'll find him in his cabin."
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.0693131685256958|"Uh!Hey, my name's Ma-ma uh Mamamarinette! Your mom sent me down here. The groove...uh... the group's waiting for you."
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.569248199462891|" Hello, Mamamarinette.Sorry. I tend to make more sense with this.That's strange. It seems you have something like this in your heart. "
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.281541228294373|" How do you do that?"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.469558596611023|" Music is often simpler than words. "
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.18841826915741|" You like Jagged Stone's music?"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.764035701751709|" He's my favorite singer!"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.459859251976013|" Mine too."
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.571335434913635|" You can have it if you like. I've got plenty. "
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.510990619659424|" Oh! Thanks!"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.41720712184906|" I think I'd better go join the... groove, you said?"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.603997528553009|" Did I really say that? Oh, no."
"Luka"|"Nadja"|-0.0207644104957581|" You're a funny girl, Marinette."
"Nadja"|"André"|0.645344853401184|" For this year's National Music Festival, Paris's city hall has organized numerous free concerts featuring big stars in some pretty prestigious locales! We're joined by our honorable Mayor, Andre Bourgeois. If you will, please tell us about the line-up!"
"André"|"Nadja"|0.557458639144897|" Well, XY will be performing at the Place de la Concord, Laura Nightingale at the Louvre, The Philharmonic Orchestra outside City Hall, and Mr. Jagged Stone at the Eiffel Tower! And let's not forget the many concerts and gigs given by the people of Paris across the city!"
"Nadja"|"Plagg"|0.710512518882751|" This is likely to be the most incredible music festival since the first one was held, right here in Paris, in 1982! I'm Nadja Chamack. Tune in here, to hear more tunes."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.730653375387192|" Come on, now. Don't be so down in the dumps. Look at the bright side. Now you can enjoy all of the concerts without leaving the comfort of your own room!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.0670934915542603|" I just wanted to go to my friend's concert, Plagg! "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.305007576942444|" Then why didn't you say so? As your friend, I'm going to give you a private concert you'll never forget! Ahem!Camembert! You're the cheese of my dreams! Camembert! You make life better than it seems!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.775058746337891|" Thanks Plagg. Best concert ever. "
"Plagg"|"Alya"|0.499229669570923|" Aww..."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.173389077186584|" Are you okay girl?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.0493607521057129|" Mmm-hmm."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.132617354393005|" I'm thinking \"Marinette the Compass\" has found herself a new statue."
"Marinette"|"Mylène"|-0.392940878868103|" What? Luka? No way! You're being ridiculous! Pff! Sure he's cool and nice and everything... but there's only one statue that drives this compass crazy!"
"Mylène"|"Roger"|0.396199703216553|" You're going to need these, believe me. "
"Roger"|"Anarka"|-0.712155640125275|"Mrs. Anarka, are you completely out of your mind? I'm reading 160 decibels! That's 10 times the sound of a jet engine! You just can't do this. You'll have to play something else!"
"Anarka"|"Roger"|0.483685493469238|" It's the National Music Festival today Officer Roger! My crew's allowed to play whatever they want!"
"Roger"|"Marinette"|-0.738914489746094|" It's a music festival, not a noise festival. If you don't turn the volume down, I'll ban your concert altogether!"
"Marinette"|"Anarka"|-0.705247551202774|" Uh, maybe we could turn the volume down a bit Captain? Then there'd be no more problem, right?"
"Anarka"|"Roger"|-0.526586711406708|" No, out of the question. I didn't name my galleon Liberty for nothing, you know! It's a matter of principle! Haven't you ever heard of freedom of speech, Roger? This is me home! I will do as I want!"
"Roger"|"Anarka"|0.250151872634888|" Do you have a document stating you can moor your houseboat in this location?"
"Anarka"|"Roger"|0.415159225463867|" The Seine belongs to everyone!"
"Roger"|"Roger"|-0.703413814306259|" You are not allowed to moor here without a parking permit! Which means you can't play your concert here either. Not to mention this incredibly messy deck! "
"Roger"|"Roger"|-0.685166656970978|" Public visual disturbance you get a ticket! And this decoration it's too decorated! Another ticket! "
"Roger"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.501004815101624|" You asked for it, One more ticket for making me use too many tickets, one more for your attitude, one because I can't sleep, one more because I'm seasick, one more because I say so"
"Hawk Moth"|"Anarka"|-0.276387512683868|" Ah, the suppression of a soul demanding liberty and freedom. A perfect target for my akuma!Fly away my little akuma and evilize her. "
"Anarka"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.716179102659225|" I refuse to give in. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Anarka"|-0.232688665390015|"Captain Hardrock, I am Hawk Moth. Is the establishment censoring your right to make as much noise as you'd like? From now on they won't hear anything but your music. I'm giving you an indestructible ship and you will use it to sale around Paris and blast your music out everywhere you go as loudly as you please. In return, you will bring me the greatest of all treasures, Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous."
"Anarka"|"Marinette"|0.692977905273438|" A treasure in return for freedom? Ho, ho, ho then I shall be your pirate Hawk Moth. "

"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.14817750453949|" Uh well, it's obvious because Marinette asked her to!"
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.137533187866211|" Or because... Ladybug and Marinette are the same person! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.243703365325928|" You're my friend, and I'd never want to lie to a friend."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.648513972759247|" But why do you think you'd be lying?"

"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.491480648517609|" Okay Adrien, this whole thing smells like rotten cheese. You know you aren't supposed to know each other's secret identities!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.404057025909424|" Just because I know her secret identity doesn't mean she has to know about mine. Everything will be just fine, I promise. "

"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|-0.484732031822205|" You're still calling me Marinette. You're not supposed to know who I am. It means that if I use my Miraculous Ladybug to fix everything now..."

I must not throw my eraser here and now, I must throw my eraser back then!"
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug"|0.149962067604065|" Do you know how Cat Noir found out about your secret identity?"
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|0.385970830917358|" I think so. When I went into Adrien's house as Ladybug, he probably saw me. He figured out that Ladybug is Marinette because of the note written on the gift. But I'm not sure what happened next. "
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug"|0.221616268157959|" He probably told his friend Nino, who told Alya, who wrote about it on the Ladyblog."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug from 10 minutes"|-0.594383209943771|" Mm.. They would never do that. But Adrien probably told someone, who told someone else, and so on, until it was all over the news! The best-kept secrets are the ones you never share."

"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.241869926452637|" Oh, Adrien Agreste! What a surprise! I brought you a gift from... your fan club in Brazil! There's a postal strike over there but they really wanted it to arrive today for Saint Athanasius Day."
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.743994951248169|"That's my... fifth name."
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|0.594266414642334|" Wow, they must be serious fans to know that about you! Well, happy Fifth Name's Day! "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.0420210361480713|" Uh... thank you. "
"Plagg"|"Ladybug"|-0.716141313314438|" Ugh, why would anyone send a beret when they could send cheese instead?"
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|-0.371581673622131|" Hey, Bunnyx, when you travel through time, do you forget what happened when you're done?"
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug"|-0.231810748577118|" What's seen can't be unseen. I know who you are, Minibug, and a few other things too. "
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|0.54398787021637|" Do you know who Hawk Moth is?"
"Bunnyx"|"Marinette"|0.129370927810669|" Even if I did, I couldn't tell you. There's a time for everything and time is a fragile thing. That's the reason you picked me, Minibug. I know how to keep a secret. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.702385455369949|" He wasn't home. His fencing competition probably ended later than expected. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.257692933082581|" What did you do with the gift?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.436045348644257|" Oh, I dropped it off at home before coming back here. I was gonna tell you that I've given it to him but the truth is I just couldn't do it! But I promise next time, it'll work. You know what they say, 563rd time's a charm! "

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.597005486488342|" I did it. "
"Cat Noir"|"ja"|-0.600339144468307|"I have no idea what you're talking about, but I'm perfectly fine with it."

"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.521704077720642|" Heroes Day?!I completely forgot to plan my good deed today!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.719149380922318|" And the fact that you were up all night saving Paris isn't enough of a good deed?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.19179356098175|" No, Tikki. Because that was a secret and Ladybug's good deed. Heroes Day is when everyday citizens perform a good deed for other people's benefit.Come on, Tikki. "
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.689578533172607|" Dad, Mom, it's Heroes' Day today!"
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.632893323898315|" Just like every year, sweetie.I've put one of every flavor in there for each of your classmates."

"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.379557132720947|"Heroes Day... We're already heroes. Come on, let's go back to bed!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.251582622528076|" Plagg!Do you really have to eat that so early in the morning?"
"Plagg"|"Nathalie"|0.106022000312805|"Mhm."
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|0.574479103088379|" The fencing hall is booked for 6:05 p.m. and the Chinese classroom for 6:35 p.m. just as you wished, and remember that you have to make an appearance in the Agreste Foundation's Heroes Gala."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.646050095558167|" I'll be there for sure. "
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.667564034461975|" If it were to fail Nathalie, I could never forgive myself."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.257900357246399|" You made a promise to your wife. You've risked so much for the chance to bring her back.Lila has been harboring her rage against Ladybug for months, and today wherever she looks, she'll see the object of her hatred, and as predicted, her anger will reach devastating heights. Your plan is perfect, sir."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.650066614151001|" And you're sure you want to do this?"
"Nathalie"|"Lila"|0.62816059589386|" I will always be here for you. We will succeed. "
"Lila"|"Miss Bustier's class"|0.219002604484558|"Hello, everyone!"
"Miss Bustier's class"|"Miss Bustier"|0.475577473640442|" Hi Lila!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Lila"|0.515812516212463|" We can't wait to hear what you've been doing since our last video chat. Tell us about your week in the Kingdom of Achu."
"Lila"|"Marinette"|0.805532336235046|" It's absolutely amazing! Prince Ali invited me and my parents to his gorgeous palace."
"Marinette"|"Lila"|-0.651541113853455|" Excuse me, Lila, but Prince Ali couldn't possibly have invited you because he is in the United States. "
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.547350764274597|"I never said he was actually there, Marinette. I just said he invited us, that's all. His parents organized the visit-"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.439307570457458|" She's lying, and I'll expose her for the fake that she is."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.684958159923553|" Oh no, Marinette, not that again. She's not a liar. You're just jealous of Lila because she tried to hit on Adrien."
"Marinette"|"Lila"|-0.462493658065796|" Nu-uh. Not. True."
"Lila"|"Class"|0.55888843536377|" I miss you guys so much. It's so hard being away on this magical trip so far from my friends, and especially on Heroes Day."
"Class"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.289421319961548|" Aw!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Lila"|0.769834995269775|" Lila, what good deed are you planning to do on this special day?"
"Lila"|"Marinette"|0.733687400817871|" Today I'll be meeting up with Prince Ali to show him an idea I came up with. Marinette? Prince Ali is coming back to Achu today, isn't he?"
"Marinette"|"Max"|0.39931058883667|" Yeah, that's right."
"Max"|"Rose"|0.603798389434814|" What idea is this, Lila?"
"Rose"|"Lila"|0.730410218238831|" I'm sure it's amazing! "
"Lila"|"Miss Bustier"|0.00427412986755371|" Oh, it's nothing much! During our world travels, my diplomat parents have helped me convince the leaders of several nations to agree to reduce world pollution.And I'm very optimistic that the prince will jump on board."
"Miss Bustier"|"Lila"|0.685773134231567|" That's incredible, Lila! Thank you on behalf of planet Earth."
"Lila"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.0317703485488892|" Well sure. Superheroes like Ladybug might save lives, but they couldn't care less about the environment, so somebody has to come to the rescue. "
"Miss Bustier"|"Lila"|0.674949407577515|" I'm sure Ladybug would be very impressed by what you're doing."
"Lila"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.498884737491608|" Thank you for your encouraging words. I'm sorry, but it's late here with the time difference. As you can see behind me, the sun's already going down. I have to leave you now. See you soon!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Class"|0.50553834438324|" Thank you so much for calling us, Lila. And good luck with your project. "
"Class"|"Lila"|-0.479446947574615|" Bye! "
"Lila"|"Lila's Mother"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Lila's Mother"|"Lila"|-0.256252527236938|"Who was that on the phone?"
"Lila"|"Lila's Mother"|-0.144971907138824|" Mom? You know perfectly well that was my boyfriend, Adrien. He misses me so much he can't stop calling."
"Lila's Mother"|"Lila"|-0.660771280527115|" And school still hasn't reopened yet?"
"Lila"|"Lila's Mother"|-0.699122816324234|" No. It's too dangerous with all these akumatizations happening."
"Lila's Mother"|"Lila"|0.0481400489807129|"Ah, there he is now, your school principal."
"Lila"|"Lila's Mother"|-0.742350995540619|" Do not answer him!He's been akumatized too! Another poor soul that useless Ladybug was unable to save."
"Lila's Mother"|"Lila's Mother"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?"
"Lila's Mother"|"Lila"|-0.473737299442291|" All these akumatizations are quite concerning. I'll bring it up at our next embassy meeting.Ciao my bella! Your lunch is in the fridge. I'll try not to be home too late."
"Lila"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.790511652827263|" Grr..."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.576519697904587|" Lila's parents must be caught in a typhoon overseas. I can't get ahold of them. It is now the hour of The Owl! Hoo! Hoo!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.165534138679504|" Well, it isn't going to be easy living up to Lila's standards but let's not forget that we can all be heroes for this one day. We may not have Prince Ali as a friend but..."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Miss Bustier"|0.757938981056213|" We do have imagination. Hoo! Hoo!This year, Ladybug and Cat Noir have been our heroes, protecting us from the terrible Hawk Moth. They've shown us that heroism is beyond comic books and fairy tales. Heroism is real, and it is up to you to show us how Ladybug and Cat Noir brought out the best in all of us. By being everyday heroes. "
"Miss Bustier"|"Nino"|0.512933731079102|" So what heroic deeds have you all planned? Nino?"
"Nino"|"Miss Bustier"|0.807779431343079|" I gotta admit, I've never used to do anything for anyone before, but Ladybug and Cat Noir have shown me what being cool is really about.So this year, I'm going to visit the elderly residents at the local retirement home and play them all their favorite songs."
"Miss Bustier"|"Adrien"|-0.388314068317413|" Adrien?"
"Adrien"|"Miss Bustier"|0.685266375541687|" Today I plan to give my fencing classmates a lesson in Chinese and my Chinese classmates a lesson in fencing."
"Miss Bustier"|"Alya"|-0.557039171457291|" Alya?"
"Alya"|"Miss Bustier"|0.743083953857422|" Last year, I wrote an article about equiping public buildings with disabled access. But after seeing Ladybug and Cat Noir going that extra mile every single day, I decided that I, too, can do better. So I got the mayor's approval to improve facilties so that handicap kids can actually attend our school."
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|0.53876268863678|" What about you, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.348558902740479|" Uh...so I, uh, yeah. I have...macarons. "
"Chloé"|"Alya"|-0.422953963279724|" Wow, like every year? You obviously went above and beyond, Dupain-Cheng. "
"Alya"|"Chloé"|0.516106367111206|" Hey! She did what she could, and that's better than nothing."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.744860529899597|" Hey, I am doing something. Now that I'm a superhero myself, I'll be signing autographs for anyone who wants one. "
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier's class"|0.331650853157043|" Wait! It's not just macarons for us. I'm actually organizing a school-wide macaron tasting. "
"Miss Bustier's class"|"Marinette"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Marinette"|"Ivan"|0.742120265960693|" Yeah. And they'll be more than just macarons, too. They'll be pastries and pies and fruits and cakes for anyone who wants them. I invite everybody to the biggest tasting at the park tonight. "
"Ivan"|"Miss Bustier's class"|0.694604992866516|" Cake for everyone!"
"Miss Bustier's class"|"Tom"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.245345413684845|" Oh, wow. That's not the same as every year, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.471684217453003|" How 'bout just half, then? 500 macarons, 100 pies, 300 sweet buns, and just 1000 crossiants. That should be enough. "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.0840919017791748|" If I didn't have this giant Ladybug cake to finish by tonight, I would gladly rise to the challenge but there's simply no way I can do both. I've committed myself, Marinette. I can't let the mayor down."
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|-0.283795952796936|" And I committed myself way over my head. Now I'm gonna let my whole class down."
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.0693714022636414|" It's not too late to tell them the truth. Your friends will understand."
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|-0.257399916648865|" But it won't be very heroic. "
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.158753097057343|" Yes, it will. Being brave enough to face one's mistakes is heroic."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.518964052200317|" You're right.If I get to work right away, I'll have enough time to make the macarons by myself. "
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.761307954788208|"Sir, Adrien has a special request. He'd like to go to a picnic tonight."

"Lila"|"Gabriel"|-0.784656956791878|"Liar! Traitor! Coward! "
"Gabriel"|"Lila"|0.42913818359375|"In honor of the wonderful Ladybug who has saved my son Adrien and myself, and who relentlessly protects all of us everyday, I have financed this tribute to Ladybug. Because Ladybug is the only true hero unlike her mediocre imitations, such as Volpina."

"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.215422987937927|" Why don't you just transform me into Ladybug instead? With a bit of luck, my Lucky Charm will give us a giant electric whisk or an oven full of quiches."

"Nora"|"Ella and Etta"|0.203263640403748|" Ha, I told you so! If that fly-weight is talking to them, it means that Ladybug and “Mister Whiskers” is still around, and on the good guys' side."
"Ella and Etta"|"Queen Bee"|0.451093077659607|" Yay! Ladybug! Ladybug!"
"Queen Bee"|"Cat Noir"|-0.636741191148758|" Don't get too cocky Hawk Moth. I'm gonna sting you where it hurts."
"Cat Noir"|"Carapace"|-0.100770711898804|" It's only like ten villains for everyone of us. Who wants Hawk Moth? How about we play rock, paper , scissors for it."
"Carapace"|"Rena Rouge"|0.365280151367188|" I got your back."
"Rena Rouge"|"Carapace"|-0.658842504024506|" No, I got your back."

"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.279583930969238|" So, what's the heroes' plan m'lady? "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.0173465609550476|" Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.0312457084655762|"How'd you pull this off, Alya? You're the best. I can't believe you got everyone to swap seats so I can sit next to Adrien. Then again, it might not be the best idea. It could keep me from paying attention in class, and if I fail it'd be a total disaster because then Adrien and I would never have our own house, the three kids, the hamster named–"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.558205425739288|"Whoa girl, what are you talking about? You're not sitting next to Adrien. Your seat's over there."
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.546288818120956|" At the back? Why? What's going on?"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.408231258392334|" Well since she's got a hearing issue, there's no way she can sit at the back of the class, right? Which means she needed a place up in the front."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.737830519676208|" So to make it work Ivan sat next to Mylène, Nate sat next to Alix, besides she came up with the idea of moving Nino here, so now we get to spend more time together."
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|0.635672092437744|" Who is this \"she\"?"
"Miss Bustier"|"Lila"|0.742536425590515|" Good morning, students. I'm sure you've all heard by now, but Lila's home from her trip to Achu and she's back in school with us again."
"Lila"|"Class"|0.302563071250916|"Hi, everyone."
"Class"|"Lila"|0.475577473640442|" Hi, Lila."
"Lila"|"Marinette"|0.345505833625793|" Oh, a seat in the front row! You all remembered my hearing issue! You're such sweethearts, all of you. "
"Marinette"|"Lila"|-0.644621968269348|" You have a hearing problem, Lila?"
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.748739778995514|" Yes, I suffer from tinnitus, a constant ringing in my left ear. I've had it ever since the sound of an airplane engine burst my eardrum on the runaway when I was saving Jagged Stone's lost kitten. "
"Marinette"|"Lila"|-0.408333897590637|" Isn't Jagged Stone's pet a crocodile?"
"Lila"|"Adrien"|0.662427306175232|" Now it is, yes. But he had a kitten until he found out he was allergic to it. The best part is, since you're such an excellent student, Adrien, you'll be able to help me catch up with all the schoolwork I missed while I was traveling with my parents. Would you do that for me?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.619923114776611|" Sure, Lila."
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.413445115089417|" Miss Bustier, why do I have to sit in the back now?"
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|-0.731829911470413|" Do you have any trouble hearing or seeing, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.511240422725677|" Uh, I… I…"
"Adrien"|"Marinette and Lila"|0.575674295425415|" My eyesight and hearing are good. I'll sit in the back of the class and you two can sit up front. I don't mind."
"Marinette and Lila"|"Lila"|-0.586760878562927|" No!"
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.779752239584923|" My return is causing so much trouble, maybe I should have just stayed on the other side of the world. If Marinette has an issue too, then I should be the one to go and sit in the back. It's okay."
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.614596724510193|" I don't actually have any trouble seeing or hearing. I mean…"
"Miss Bustier"|"Hawk Moth"|0.288346290588379|" Good, so there's no problem then. You sit here, Lila, Adrien, you stay where you are and, Marinette, you sit in the back row."
"Hawk Moth"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.700088292360306|" Ah, high school, the arena of teenage angst, where emotions are so intense. A perfect stadium for my dear akumas. Being separated from your friends, becoming isolated:just what devastating anger is made of. Fly away and evilize this angry high school girl."
"Miss Bustier"|"Hawk Moth"|0.424672961235046|"Open your books to page 23."
"Hawk Moth"|"Sabrina"|-0.755386009812355|" Strange, I feel the fury dying down, but the wheels are in motion. It's only a matter of time, be patient now my akuma."
"Sabrina"|"Lila"|0.589998126029968|" That's for you, Lila! "
"Lila"|"Max"|0.604785084724426|" Thank you. You're so sweet! "
"Max"|"Mylène"|0.623175144195557|" Here's your appetizer, Lila!"
"Mylène"|"Kim"|0.659924864768982|" And I've got your main course!"
"Kim"|"Lila"|0.566802620887756|" I'll fetch your dessert!"
"Lila"|"Kim"|-0.769939064979553|" I'm sorry I can't carry my own tray. It's almost impossible with this sprained wrist."
"Kim"|"Marinette"|-0.76048643887043|"Sorry."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.687249720096588|" Lila's totally lying. She made up that whole tinnitus story just so she could sit next to Adrien, and her sprained wrist's completely bogus, too."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.651880472898483|" I don't get it, Marinette. You barely know Lila. Why all the hate?"
"Marinette"|"Alya and Nino"|-0.079802393913269|" Fine, I'll tell you everything.You remember Lila when she first came to school right after the summer break? She was only here for one day and then she left on that 'round-the-world trip. Everyone was captivated by her. Something just felt off to me. So I followed her."
"Alya and Nino"|"Lila"|-0.612575769424438|" What?"
"Lila"|"Marinette"|0.498259663581848|"Not only did Ladybug save my life, we've become very close friends."
"Marinette"|"Nino"|0.0489426851272583|" She lies with every breath."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.491609334945679|" Wait. You eavesdropped on Lila and Adrien? That's not cool."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.272617816925049|" A good reporter always verifies her sources. Can you prove she doesn't actually know Ladybug?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.533179044723511|" Well I–uh… I… I…Okay! You want proof she's lying? Hey Lila! You forgot your napkin!"
"Marinette"|"Lila"|-0.689286917448044|" Ha, ha! See that? It's obvious she doesn't have a sprained wrist. "
"Lila"|"Max"|-0.698475450277328|"Uh, ow! Once when I was in India, I witnessed someone getting their eye gouged out by the corner of a napkin. If I hadn't caught it, this napkin could've injured Max. I didn't have a choice. Ow!"
"Max"|"Lila"|0.206318259239197|" Lila, you saved my eye! You sacrificed yourself for me."
"Lila"|"Sabrina"|0.149060606956482|" Why wouldn't I, Max? Ouch. You're my friend."
"Sabrina"|"Mylène"|0.379702806472778|" We'll take you to the nurse's office."
"Mylène"|"Kim"|0.679126858711243|"Are you proud of yourself?"
"Kim"|"Lila"|-0.756286859512329|" Lila's in even more pain now, all because of you."
"Lila"|"Lila"|-0.707230240106583|" No, no, don't blame Marinette. She was just trying to give me a napkin. Right, Marinette?"
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.766266971826553|" Marinette? Oh, are you crying?"
"Marinette"|"Lila"|-0.60816302895546|" No, I'm not!"
"Lila"|"Ladybug"|-0.653399527072906|" I can sense that you don't like me, but I don't understand why. We barely know each other."
"Ladybug"|"Lila"|-0.17167603969574|"Miss Show-Off here was trying to impress you."
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.364362418651581|" Don't tell me it's because of this new seating arrangement in class!It is! Of course, you're jealous because I'm sitting next to Adrien, because you would've given anything to sit there yourself. You know what? It's really not worth fighting over a boy. You and I could be friends, and who knows, I might even be able to help you with Adrien."
"Marinette"|"Lila"|-0.539565324783325|" You and I will only be friends the day you stop lying, Lila!I can't prove it, but I know for a fact that you don't have tinnitus, that your wrist is just fine, that you don't know Prince Ali because you've never even stepped foot in Achu, and despite what you got Alya to write on her Ladyblog, Ladybug has never saved your life!"
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.374826729297638|" I only tell people what they want to hear."
"Marinette"|"Lila"|-0.429902195930481|" It's called lying!"
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.656625181436539|" There's nothing you can do about it, anyway. People can't resist when they hear what they like to hear. If you don't want to be my friend, fine! But soon you won't have any friends left at all. And trust me, I'll make sure you never get close to Adrien in class or anywhere. You seem a little less dumb than the others, so I'll give you one last chance. You are either with me or against me. You don't have to answer right away. I'll give you 'till the end of class today."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.679264217615128|" I thought Chloé was evil, but Lila really takes the whole cake! She's like a supervillain who doesn't even need a costume!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.667809635400772|" You mustn't let her get to you, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.661507695913315|" If I don't manage to expose her lies, she'll ruin my life, Tikki. She'll turn my friends against me, including Adrien! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Tikki"|-0.715512990951538|" Yes! I can feel it. The anger's about to emerge!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.211540162563324|"Marinette, look out!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.0655516386032104|" Aah! An akuma!"
"Adrien"|"Lila"|0.363491415977478|" Hey, Lila."
"Lila"|"Adrien"|0.347112655639648|" Adrien, we'll have to figure when you're gonna help me catch up on all the schoolwork I missed. I also heard you play piano, my uncle's the great pianist Chuch Boroughchuck. He wanted to teach me when I was little, but I had to stop playing because of arthritis. But when my wrist gets better, I'd love for you to give me some lessons."
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.508058071136475|" Lila, I'm perfectly happy being friends with you, and I'll gladly help you catch on your schoolwork, but please don't lie to me like you did last time with Ladybug."

"Ladybug"|"Lila"|-0.633995532989502|"She's more like a super liar."
"Lila"|"Adrien"|-0.667061865329742|" Ladybug's the liar."
"Adrien"|"Lila"|-0.605486214160919|" I'm not judging you, Lila, but instead of making friends you're going to turn everyone against you. You can tell me if there's something bothering you. I can help. But you need to be honest with me."
"Lila"|"Adrien"|-0.676224768161774|" Are you trying to be some superhero lecturing me just like Ladybug did? Well thanks, but no thanks. Ugh. "
"Adrien"|"Tikki"|0.488614320755005|" I'm still here if you need help catching up with your schoolwork. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.621938318014145|" You can resist it, Marinette. Hawk Moth's power only effects people who think there's no solution to their problems, and you always find a solution."

"Hawk Moth"|"Lila"|-0.765030726790428|" What's happened? The anger has disappeared. Hmm, but I can feel something new arising."

"Ladybug"|"Lila"|-0.514678806066513|" At least now you can say I saved your life for real. Truce? "
"Lila"|"Ladybug"|0.681258797645569|" Thanks, Ladybug.I'd be honored to call you my friend."
"Ladybug"|"Lila"|0.737302541732788|" Yeah, I'm happy to hear that. Hey, some advice. You don't have to lie and pretend to be something you're not. People will like you just for being yourself."
"Lila"|"Ladybug"|0.261869668960571|" You have my word, Ladybug."
"Ladybug"|"Lila"|-0.808937206864357|" Bug out! "

"Hawk Moth"|"Lila"|0.71893298625946|" I sense a talent like no other in this young Lila. I'm sure that her feelings about Ladybug will serve my purposes well in the end. One way or another."
"Lila"|"Max"|0.658159732818604|" Of course Ladybug saved my life. She never misses an opportunity to rescue her best friends."
"Max"|"Lila"|-0.698942989110947|" Didn't your tinnitus give you vertigo when you went up the Eiffel Tower?"
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.125690519809723|" Oh no. Ladybug knows me so well that she brought me an earplug to stick in my right ear."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.210716843605042|"Right ear?! Did she say right ear?! This morning she said that the ringing was in her left ear! I've got her this time! "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.150987565517426|" Are you going to tell everyone?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.588316798210144|" 'Course I am. Lila is—"
"Adrien"|"Lila"|-0.706969290971756|"A liar. Yes, I know. But do you really think exposing her will make things better? If you humiliate her, she'll just be hurt more. Making a bad guy suffer has never turned them into a good guy."
"Lila"|"Marinette"|0.0203558206558228|" Ladybug and I are like two peas in a pod."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.00259500741958618|" So we just stand by and let her lie?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.390506029129028|" As long as you and I both know the truth, does it really matter?"
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.384126424789429|" You're right, maybe it's not such a big deal."

"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.168679296970367|" Oh. "
"Miss Bustier"|"Lila"|-0.620207548141479|" Looks like you have trouble hearing after all, Marinette. Why don't you come sit up here in the front row next to Lila."
"Lila"|"Alya"|0.213473200798035|" Miss Bustier, this is incredible. My tinnitus, I don't feel it anymore. It's gone. it's a miracle. It must be Ladybug's doing, I can sit in the back now."
"Alya"|"Alya"|0.367002725601196|" Excuse me, Miss Bustier, can I go and sit next to Marinette? Nino and I can't stop chatting it up. "
"Alya"|"Adrien"|-0.473200142383575|" You didn't think I'd let my BFF sit all by herself, did you?"
"Adrien"|"Ivan"|0.23138153553009|" Excuse me Miss Bustier, can I move, too, please? I'd like to sit next to Nino again.Sorry Lila, he's my best friend."
"Ivan"|"Alix"|0.498378038406372|" Can I have my old seat back, too, please?"
"Alix"|"Rose, Max and others"|-0.281133830547333|" Can I go back to where I was?"
"Rose, Max and others"|"Nino"|-0.135077178478241|" Me too!"
"Nino"|"Lila"|0.0899029970169067|" Catch you later, Marinette. Bye. "
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.389496564865112|" I see you've made your decision Marinette.From now on, you and I are at war. You will lose your friends and wind up all alone and Adrien will soon be mine. "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.542952656745911|" We'll see about that, Lila, we'll see. "
"Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.580488711595535|" Come on, look at all the nice plushies, don't you want to play with them?"
"Chris"|"Marinette"|-0.787191480398178|"Dolls? I hate dolls. I hate toys. They're for babies. "
"Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.432011187076569|" Yes, but you're too young to play Grim Monster Clash 3."
"Chris"|"Marinette"|-0.573876231908798|" No I'm not, and I'm not scared of monsters anymore, you know. I'm—"
"Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.315320611000061|" A big kid, yes, I know.Why don't we watch a cartoon instead? I have \"Pototty and Potato\" if you want?"
"Chris"|"Marinette"|0.537435054779053|" That show's for babies. I'm a big boy. "
"Marinette"|"Chris"|0.433507084846497|" We could play with your snow globe? "
"Chris"|"Marinette"|-0.755544096231461|" Ew! "
"Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.611643075942993|" Uh…"
"Chris"|"Marinette"|-0.0455406308174133|" Hey, what's that? "
"Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.621178597211838|"That? Oh, uh, it's nothing. "
"Chris"|"Marinette"|-0.409657180309296|" Hey, no fair! Come on! What are all those gifts?"
"Marinette"|"Chris"|0.36124312877655|"Uh, look I can't tell you that these are the gifts I've made for Adrien's next 35 birthdays. Cause you'd tell your brother Nino and he'd tell Adrien and Adrien'd think that I'm totally crazy. Wait, maybe I am.Hm. I can't tell you I'm one of Santa Claus's elves on a secret mission and that I'm looking after one of his boxes of gifts. You wouldn't be interested though because gifts are for babies, right? And you're a big kid. "
"Chris"|"Marinette"|-0.64330717921257|" That's a lie!"
"Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.304695606231689|" What, that you're a big kid?"
"Chris"|"Marinette"|-0.568282186985016|" No, that you're one of Santa Claus's elves!"
"Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.326720416545868|" I can't say anything more. "
"Chris"|"Marinette"|0.00445497035980225|" Hey wait, that means you can give me my Christmas present early! Grobotech Ultimate Destructor! It's easy, it's gotta be the biggest one in the box. "
"Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.650766223669052|" Now wait a minute, I thought toys were for babies. "
"Chris"|"Marinette"|-0.346009314060211|" They are, most of the time. But Grobotech's different. "
"Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.66220623254776|" You don't say. Well, I'm sorry, but Christmas rules are very strict. You don't open gifts early. Santa gives them at Christmas, not at Easter or Halloween. Otherwise you'd might as well have a bunny or a witch delivering your presents."
"Chris"|"Marinette"|0.353032112121582|" But, since you know him, you could ask him. Can't just you call him on the phone or send him an email?"
"Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.646727740764618|" Oh no, you never disturb Santa Claus except at Christmas. The rest of the year he's… in the North Pole... d-of the, uh, supervising the production of toys.Besides, your present isn't here anyway. We elves don't watch over gifts for kids we know. One of the elves must have it. Santa's the only one who would know where to find it because he knows who's getting what. He has a list of good children.There is one exception to the Christmas rule. "
"Chris"|"Marinette"|0.0577661991119385|" Really? What is it, what is it?"
"Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.564390271902084|" Santa is allowed to make one exception but only for the best-behaved kid in the whole world."
"Chris"|"Marinette"|0.427557826042175|" Who's the best-behaved kid in the whole world?"
"Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.143402814865112|" Hm, maybe Ladybug?"
"Chris"|"Marinette"|0.228918433189392|" Well, seeing as she saved Paris a gazillion times, that makes sense. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.379702627658844|" Or a kid for example who cleans up all the mess he's made and plays quietly with toys that are for kids his age? "
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.00346636772155762|" Marinette, we're back."
"Nino"|"Marinette"|0.630710482597351|" Did you guys have fun?"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|0.607925295829773|" Sure we did. How was the movie?"
"Nino"|"Chris"|-0.200177550315857|" Awesome. Thanks for watching my bro, Marinette. What's wrong, little dude?"
"Chris"|"Marinette"|0.396617650985718|"AH! I want it to be Christmas right now! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.226163625717163|" I have absolutely no idea where that came from."
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.27024382352829|" Okay, I guess we'd better get going. Bye, girl. "
"Nino"|"Marinette"|0.329983115196228|" See you at school tomorrow. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.0678999423980713|" Yeah, bye Nino, see you soon Chris. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.394981801509857|" A Christmas elf on a secret mission, seriously, Marinette, don't you think you went too far this time?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.40488874912262|" I know, Tikki, it was pure ridiculousness. But I couldn't tell him the truth about the gifts. Besides, I simply told Chris a nice little story, which hopefully will teach him some patience.Speaking of patience, I've got an idea of what I can give Adrien for his 50th birthday! Give me a hand?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.618057548999786|" Um? Mm hm."
"Marinette"|"Soldier"|-0.213635265827179|" Wha- um, snow? Whoa, how long was I asleep?Ah!"
"Soldier"|"Soldier"|-0.725869297981262|" It's over Santa Claus, you're surrounded. Surrender and don't put up a fight!"

"T-rex"|"Marinette"|0.324035286903381|" Santa Claus? Have you seen Santa Claus?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.388275861740112|" Okay, it's all just a dream. I'm going back to bed.Ow. Why did you do that, Tikki?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.6204814016819|" See, you're not dreaming. "
"Marinette"|" Marinette"|-0.762289389967918|" Well if I'm not, it means…This does look like a nightmare though. "
" Marinette"|"Soldier"|-0.443314373493195|" Tikki, spots on! Ha!"
"Soldier"|"Tom"|0.324035286903381|" Santa Claus, have you seen Santa Claus?"
"Tom"|"Nadja"|-0.13704925775528|" Santa Claus? But it's not Christmas yet."
"Nadja"|"Bear"|-0.487678706645966|" Nadja Chamack here, don't be bemused it's just the news.Paris has been literally invaded by giant toys looking for Santa Claus. "
"Bear"|"Ladybug"|-0.614848792552948|" Major Teddiski here, Santa Claus. All your toys are belong to us. If you don’t give yourself up real quick, this little city of Paris will go kaboom, lickety split. "
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.433070659637451|" What's going on?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.413999915122986|"Cat Noir, you'll never guess what I just found."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.3554607629776|"Actually I think I know m'lady. I'm with Santa Claus we've taken refuge in the ice rink."
"Ladybug"|"Philippe"|0.609665155410767|" I'll meet you there."
"Philippe"|"Santa Claus"|-0.208659589290619|" I can't believe it! Are you really Santa Claus?"
"Santa Claus"|"Philippe"|-0.709937512874603|" No, I'm the Easter Bunny in disguise. You can't see my long ears because of the hat. Of course I'm Santa Claus. "

"Colonel Woof-Woof"|"Soldier"|0.29384982585907|" I smell a wood fire and cinnamon cookies. Santa Claus must be nearby! Soldiers, get in line! "
"Soldier"|"Colonel Woof-Woof"|0.189058661460876|" At your command Colonel Woof-Woof."
"Colonel Woof-Woof"|"Philippe"|0.683223605155945|" Follow me this way.s Searching for Santa Claus far and wide! Searching for Santa—"
"Philippe"|"Ladybug"|0.279371619224548|" To Luna, Maya, and Thalia. When I tell my daughters I've met you, they're going to freak out! "
"Ladybug"|"Santa Claus"|-0.122851014137268|" Santa Claus?I'm so glad you're alright, but what are you doing here, it's not Christmas yet."
"Santa Claus"|"Ladybug"|-0.634634375572205|" I have no idea! I was busy supervising the production of toys for next Christmas with my elves when all of a sudden, bang! I woke up in my sleigh in the Paris sky. Flying catfishes destroyed my sleigh. My reindeer were able to get away, but if it hadn't been for Cat Noir, they would have captured me."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.2384272813797|"Don't you think this whole thing is kind of strange?"
"Cat Noir"|"Colonel Woof-Woof"|-0.347181677818298|" Stranger than fighting a pharaoh's reincarnation or a pigeon overlord empowered by magical butterflies, you mean?"
"Colonel Woof-Woof"|"Philippe and Ladybug"|-0.163993060588837|" Aha! Gotcha!"
"Philippe and Ladybug"|"Colonel Woof-Woof"|-0.587292939424515|" Ah!"
"Colonel Woof-Woof"|"Cat Noir"|-0.69134533405304|" My sense of smell has sniffed you out, Santa. Follow me and do not show resistance."
"Cat Noir"|"Colonel Woof-Woof"|0.042205810546875|" Stay back, Santa!"
"Colonel Woof-Woof"|"Ladybug"|0.186295747756958|" Christmaster demands his gift."
"Ladybug"|"Santa Claus"|-0.530486613512039|" Christmaster?"
"Santa Claus"|"Philippe"|-0.723325401544571|" Christmas gifts must be deserved, and they're only given at Christmas. If you think I'm going to bend the rules, you're barking up the wrong tree. "
"Philippe"|"Colonel Woof-Woof"|-0.682565867900848|"Now hold on a minute, there's no use in fighting, that's not the Christmas spirit, now is it?"
"Colonel Woof-Woof"|"Philippe"|-0.413255751132965|" Hm?"
"Philippe"|"Colonel Woof-Woof"|-0.638466149568558|"Would it be such a big deal if you gave the presents early, just this once?"
"Colonel Woof-Woof"|"Philippe"|0.0784127712249756|" Listen to the smart man."
"Philippe"|"Cat Noir"|0.623137950897217|"And while we're at it, I asked for Super Blades and I could really use them for my upcoming competition."
"Cat Noir"|"Santa Claus"|0.5539391040802|" I kinda like this idea. I asked for—"
"Santa Claus"|"Philippe and Cat Noir"|-0.695998966693878|" Stop! That's not the way it works. "
"Philippe and Cat Noir"|"Santa Claus"|0.332911133766174|"Aw, why not?"
"Santa Claus"|"Santa Claus and Ladybug"|-0.69462850689888|" Christmas rules are very strict. You don't open gifts early. I give them at Christmas, not Easter or Halloween. Otherwise…"
"Santa Claus and Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.00488507747650146|"…you might as well have a bunny or a witch delivering your presents!"
"Ladybug"|"Philippe"|-0.741373211145401|" Oh no, what have I done?"
"Philippe"|"Cat Noir"|-0.55478772521019|" But couldn't you…"
"Cat Noir"|"Santa Claus"|-0.549516022205353|" …make an exception?"
"Santa Claus"|"Philippe and Cat Noir"|-0.306844830513|"Tradition is tradition if we stop respecting it, then it's the end of Christmas."
"Philippe and Cat Noir"|"Santa Claus"|-0.289421319961548|" Aw. "
"Santa Claus"|"Santa Claus and Ladybug"|-0.596208691596985|" Well, there is one case in which I could make an exception for—"
"Santa Claus and Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.054760217666626|" —The best-behaved kid in the whole world. "
"Ladybug"|"Santa Claus"|0.755053997039795|" The one at the top of your list of good children."
"Santa Claus"|"Colonel Woof-Woof"|-0.306101441383362|" Bravo, Ladybug. At last someone who knows the rules of Christmas. But I doubt your Christmaster is the best-behaved kid in the whole world."
"Colonel Woof-Woof"|"Soldier"|-0.189195811748505|" In that case, soldiers, attack!"
"Soldier"|"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|-0.777096107602119|" Attack!"
"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|"Santa Claus"|-0.587292939424515|" Ah!"
"Santa Claus"|"Philippe"|-0.749707251787186|" Why so much hatred? "
"Philippe"|"Ladybug"|0.170682907104492|" Ladybug, Cat Noir, protect Santa, I can take care of these toys!Hahahaha, triple axel, and a pike spin into a double toe loop.Not so high and mighty now, are we?Ow! Such sharp teeth for a toy! Get me out of here!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.160441398620605|" I think I know who the toys' master is. I should have thought of it sooner. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.550297975540161|" Who is he?"
"Ladybug"|"Colonel Woof-Woof"|0.257811188697815|" I just have to check first to be sure. May I Santa?That smell of a wood fire and cinnamon cookies. It's so Christmassy.You're up, Santa Cat."
"Colonel Woof-Woof"|"Cat Noir"|0.544049263000488|"This way! I smell Santa Claus's scent. "
"Cat Noir"|"Colonel Woof-Woof"|0.534202456474304|" Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas everyone."
"Colonel Woof-Woof"|"Philippe"|0.286327242851257|" There he is! I can smell him. He is not far. Follow me! "
"Philippe"|"Ladybug"|-0.238111972808838|" Ladybug, Cat Noir, oh!"
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.174332499504089|" Come on Santa, I know where to find Christmaster. "
"Nino"|"Santa Claus"|-0.612824678421021|" Chris! Chris! Chris! Ladybug! My little bro Chris, he was in his bedroom and then he disappeared! Uh, Santa Claus? "
"Santa Claus"|"Ladybug"|0.221142888069153|" Ho ho, hello, Nino! "
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|-0.309789896011353|" Nino, I think Chris has been akumatized. Did you notice anything different about his room? "
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|-0.600438207387924|"His favorite toys have gone missing, too."
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|-0.54224756360054|" Plastic soldiers, a catfish?"
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|0.569602251052856|" Yes! Plus his dinosaur."
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.185086250305176|" So he is the toys' master. But, he could be anywhere, how are we gonna find him?"
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|-0.0366620421409607|"Please save the little dude, Ladybug. "
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.658301115036011|" Lucky Charm! "
"Nino"|"Santa Claus"|-0.540265113115311|" Stationary?"
"Santa Claus"|"Ladybug"|-0.252502620220184|" You make surprise gifts appear? Are competing with me, Ladybug? "
"Ladybug"|"Santa Claus"|0.741872191429138|" Of course! You're right! A surprise gift!Could have my Christmas present right now, Santa? Please?"
"Santa Claus"|"Ladybug"|-0.294939756393433|" You know that I can't do that Ladybug."
"Ladybug"|"Santa Claus"|-0.548837065696716|" Except…"
"Santa Claus"|"Ladybug"|-0.0779488682746887|" For the best-behaved kid in the whole world. But…"
"Ladybug"|"Santa Claus"|0.700371384620667|" It's certainly worth a try. "
"Santa Claus"|"Nino"|0.0960273742675781|"Unbelievable! Ladybug, you are the best-behaved kid in the whole world."
"Nino"|"Santa Claus"|0.300073862075806|" Well, seeing as she saved Paris a gazillion times, it totally makes sense. "
"Santa Claus"|"Ladybug"|0.293784737586975|"\"Dear Santa, I want the same gift as Chris Lahiffe, whatever it is.\" Are you sure about this? You know that this is the only gift you'll get this whole year from me. "
"Ladybug"|"Santa Claus"|-0.216941058635712|" Yes, I know, but I'm doing it to save Paris and Nino's little brother."
"Santa Claus"|"Ladybug"|0.583762168884277|" Ah, you really do deserve to be at the top of my list. Merry Christmas, Ladybug. "
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.0278589725494385|" Thank you Santa, now get to safety. I'll take it from here. "
"Nino"|"Santa Claus"|0.145244479179382|" By the way Santa, where do I fall on the list? "
"Santa Claus"|"Nino"|-0.611643075942993|" Uh…"
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|-0.289421319961548|" Aw… "
"Ladybug"|"Christmaster"|0.664858222007751|"Christmaster, I've got your Christmas present. Come and get it if you want it. Huh?Hm! "

"Bear"|"Cat Noir"|-0.673892706632614|" He tried to trick us by dressing up as Cat Noir. But he couldn't fool us. "

"Christmaster"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.790003880858421|" You were tricked! That's Cat Noir dressed up as Santa Claus, not the other way around! You're such babies!Keep searching! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Christmaster"|-0.283717513084412|" It doesn't matter, Christmaster, you don't need Santa Claus anymore now that you have your present. I, on the other hand, haven't yet received mine. Take Cat Noir's Miraculous. Then all you have to do is get a hold of Ladybug's magic jewels."
"Christmaster"|"Ladybug"|-0.177475333213806|" Give your paw, kitty cat, Hawk Moth wants your ring. It's a stupid dumb-dumb Christmas gift, but that's his price.Ladybug?"
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.733749568462372|" Christmas presents are delivered on Christmas Eve, and only to the good kids, Christmaster. I hate to say you and Hawk Moth didn't even make Santa's list."
"Hawk Moth"|"Christmaster"|0.353500485420227|"That's where you're wrong, Ladybug. You've just brought me my second gift, which only goes to show what a good Hawk Moth I've been this year. Use the powers I gave you Christmaster and seize their Miraculous."
"Christmaster"|"Ladybug"|0.590643525123596|"I have my secret weapons to fight you with. Yourselves!Have fun dumb-dumbs!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.331107795238495|" Well at least now we know for sure that the akuma is in his snow globe."

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.46760082244873|" Goodbye? Why?"
"Ladybug"|"Santa Claus"|-0.271034359931946|"Because Santa was brought here by Christmaster's power, so when everything's repaired…"
"Santa Claus"|"Ladybug"|-0.462615787982941|" …I'll be gone, 'til next Christmas! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.223827004432678|" Miraculous Ladybug! "
"Cat Noir"|"Chris"|0.687109708786011|" So big kid, feeling better?"
"Chris"|"Ladybug"|-0.608917266130447|" Yeah, but, I don't remember much. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.651457190513611|" Don't worry, everything's fine."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.0190770626068115|" Come on, big boy."

"Chris"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.499047756195068|" Goodbye, Ladybug!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Nino"|-0.116366803646088|" You stole my Christmas presents, Ladybug. But my birthday's coming soon, and trust me, I'll make sure it's a day you'll never forget. "
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.460644960403442|" Thanks again for looking after the little dude, Marinette. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.59918999671936|" Have fun! "
"Marinette"|"Chris"|0.224916696548462|" Sure will! It'll be awesome. We're really good buddies.I know I shouldn't have told you that I was one of Santa's elves. But you were acting like—"
"Chris"|"Marinette"|-0.631572604179382|" A baby, I know. Mommy says lying is wrong. So from now on, we'll always tell each other the truth, okay? "
"Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.365399062633514|" Okay. As long as you stop trying to act all grown up. "
"Chris"|"Marinette"|-0.184120118618011|" You're not an elf, but you still have another secret, right? "
"Marinette"|"Chris"|0.0806243419647217|"Uh, another secret, what-what do you mean, like a secret identity?"
"Chris"|"Tikki"|-0.287621319293976|" No, the secret in that chest! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.413255751132965|" Hm?"
"Marinette"|"Chris"|0.626966238021851|" Okay. The truth. There's this guy at school I have a crush on-"
"Chris"|"Marinette"|-0.689060091972351|"Ew! No stop! I hate romantic stuff. Gross! "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.674447894096375|"Oh, I am so in love.I dream about holding his hand, looking at the stars together..."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.637421488761902|" How about inviting him to a movie then?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.161326289176941|" Right, Tikki. Can you imagine that conversation?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.304257988929749|" \"Hey Adrien, would you like to gah— wuh,glah.\""
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.0967690944671631|" Exactly. I can't help it. Every time I see him,I get all clammy and I feel like fainting."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.0705022811889648|" So... basically the only way you could have a normal conversation with him, is if you're blindfolded."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.147725760936737|" Pretty much."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.214133977890015|" There is a very simple solution, Marinette, it's called a cell phone. You just need his number."
"Marinette"|"André"|0.641225695610046|" I know who'll have Adrien's number!"
"André"|"Théo"|0.546351909637451|" I'm sure you've outdone yourself, Théo."
"Théo"|"André"|0.73418116569519|" It was my honor. And I can't wait to meet Ladybug, I hope she'll autograph the photo I used as the inspiration for the statue."
"André"|"Alya"|0.478017807006836|" Oh, it's nearly time. Ladybug and Cat Noir should already be here by now."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.374439477920532|" Look, we all know improv's not your bag,so just stick to this script."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.561974257230759|" But all the teachers say I don't sound natural when I read."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.469273567199707|" Then memorize it. It's pretty simple. You can do this. Just don't improvise. Got it?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.687994629144669|"Forget it! This is never gonna work!"
"Alya"|"Adrien's voice recorder"|-0.583302587270737|"Too late. It's dialing. "
"Adrien's voice recorder"|"Marinette"|0.15326714515686|" Hey, this is Adrien's voicemail. Leave a message."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.767801120877266|" It's gone to voicemail!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.592649728059769|" Leave a message! Don't improv!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.247945427894592|" Uhh, hello. Uh, Adrien's voicemail, uh, this is Marinette, who, uh, has a message for you, of course, cause it's, uh, your phone, so, umm...Callmeseeyoulater,bye! "
"Marinette"|"Automated voice"|-0.695488333702087|"What? What did you expect me to say? \"Hey, hot stuff, this is Marinette, I'd ask you on a date to a movie, but I've got such a crazy crush on you that the only way I can talk to you without foaming out the mouth is over this stupid phone.\" Pretty ridiculous, right?"
"Automated voice"|"Marinette"|-0.573751598596573|"If you wish to hear your message again, press 1. If you wish to erase your message, press 2."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.249290764331818|" "

"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.680535078048706|" It's not as bad as you think."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.560151398181915|" Hmm?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.469461560249329|" Okay, it's bad. But you were gonna have to tell him one of these days, some way or another. Think of it this way: no more secrets!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.269010543823242|" The voicemail recorded my whole conversation."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.0122311115264893|" Big deal!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.738234966993332|" I called him \"hot stuff\". He cannot be allowed to hear that message, Alya! If he does, I'll die of shame!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.0166870355606079|" Okay, okay. I got an idea. If Adrien's phone went to voicemail, it means the dude's busy. Which also means you can get to it before he does. Hmm, I wonder where he'd be..."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.379771649837494|" Of course! He's got fencing club after school, that's why he didn't pick up! It ends in exactly twenty-two and a half minutes."

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.247541666030884|" Isn't Ladybug supposed to be at the unveiling?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.0547834634780884|" Yes, but Marinette needs to be at the school first."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.40405809879303|" But it is a ceremony in your honor."
"Marinette"|"Théo"|0.641749501228333|" And it's my honor that's at stake right now. I'll be in and out of there in five minutes. We can be at the ceremony in no time!"

"Cat Noir"|"Théo"|-0.217019140720367|" Don't worry about Ladybug. I'm sure she'll be here any minute. I can handle this situation alone for now. I'm the one in charge anyway, you know."
"Théo"|"André"|0.67185652256012|" It's just that, I wanted to ask her to autograph this photo. She's amazing. She's so brave and smart, the way she always saves everyone..."
"André"|"Théo"|0.323224782943726|" Perhaps the ceremony should commence. It might bring her here faster."

"Cat Noir"|"Théo"|-0.262692272663116|" These statues are amazing. One thing's slightly off though— I'm actually taller than Ladybug."
"Théo"|"Cat Noir"|0.426751732826233|" Ladybug didn't show up. I just wanted to express my adoration for her. Let her know that everything I had went into her statue. I'm sure if she took a little time to get to know me, she would see how much we have in common. Our devotion to the things we love."
"Cat Noir"|"Théo"|-0.0459429025650024|" Hey, don't mean to burst your bubble, but you know, Ladybug and me, we're a thing, you know?"

"Théo"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.608652859926224|" A thing, huh? You don't even take love seriously. Calling it a thing... You don't deserve her! I do!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.44149923324585|" Disappointed by Ladybug and jealous of Cat Noir. The perfect formula for disaster.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize him!"

What if he tracks it?He'll figure out I stole it, I'll be arrested for grand theft, I'll spend the rest of my life in jail, and worse, I'll never get to go to the movies with Adrien! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.400606334209442|" Oh, Marinette. You really need to get your priorities in order."
"Marinette"|"Adrien's Voicemail"|-0.64704555273056|" I know. Some days it feels impossible to balance being Marinette and being Ladybug."

"Luka"|"Alya"|-0.461337924003601|" Marinette hasn't come around here for a while. Is she okay?"
"Alya"|"Luka"|0.585170865058899|"Oh, yeah! Yeah! She's fine. It's just that she... she... she's got a lot of stuff going on."
"Luka"|"Rose"|-0.69142946600914|" You can be honest with me, you know? She's stopped showing up because she knows I'm in love with her, right?"
"Rose"|"Luka"|-0.579137444496155|" Of course not, Luka! Marinette stopped coming because the rehearsals are the exact same time as her Aqua Pony classes with Pom-pony, her favorite pony! Pom-pony is so cute, with his golden mane that's so brush-able, but he's also super sensitive and everytime Marinette misses Aqua Pony, Pom-pony gets depressed! "
"Luka"|"Alya"|0.358354568481445|" I get it, Rose. Thanks. "
"Alya"|"Rose"|-0.0917234420776367|"Wow, Rose."
"Rose"|"Mylène"|-0.45923125743866|" I know, but we couldn't tell him that Marinette is too embarrassed to see him. It would have broken his heart! We've gotta find a way to patch things up between them so they can see each other and be buddies again! We can all be buddies, right? Oh, I know! Luka could go to Aqua Pony class with Marinette!"
"Mylène"|"Rose"|-0.563133746385574|" You know that \"aqua pony\" is not real, don't you?"
"Rose"|"Mylène"|0.0963864326477051|"Oh. Yeah, right!"
"Mylène"|"Zoé"|0.209856510162354|" I'm sure we can figure out a way to get Luka and Marinette together!"
"Zoé"|"Ivan"|0.673334002494812|" Something that Marinette has to come to."
"Ivan"|"Nino"|0.538677453994751|" Where they'll talk to each other!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.63360333442688|" And be buddies again!"
"Alya"|"Mylène"|0.537098288536072|" Hey, aren't we all going to see the Rock and Monster Party Parade together this Saturday? What if, instead of going to the movies, we had a party right here on the houseboat! For Juleka's birthday... and Luka's!"
"Mylène"|"Zoé"|0.704943060874939|" Of course! Since they're twins, it's Luka's birthday, too, which means he'll be there!"
"Zoé"|"Nino"|-0.0918731093406677|" And Marinette!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.252080917358398|" Wait a sec, Adrien can't come this Saturday! He's got a fashion show."
"Alya"|"Alix"|-0.0842674970626831|" Perfect! If Adrien shows up, Marinette wouldn't be able to take her eyes off him."
"Alix"|"Zoé"|0.744160890579224|" And she might act... well, you know?"
"Zoé"|"Nino"|0.603122234344482|" I'll help set up!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.212128281593323|" I'm on music!"
"Alya"|"Mylène"|0.670701265335083|" And I'll take care of Marinette!"
"Mylène"|"Juleka"|0.537643313407898|" What do you think, Juleka? Awesome idea, right?"
"Juleka"|"Rose"|-0.195512175559998|" I... yeah."
"Rose"|"Marinette"|0.686008810997009|" Thanks, Jul. You're the best! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.303312122821808|" A party on the house boat for Juleka's birthday? Okay.Oh! Wait a minute, Alya Césaire. We were supposed to go to the movies for Juleka's birthday, but now we're having a party on the houseboat and since Luka is Juleka's twin, it's also his birthday, which means he'll be there! But you thought I'd never figure that out and would end up on the houseboat with him, and since the houseboat is on the river, I'd have no way of leaving, and I'd be forced to talk to him! It's a trap!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.538251399993896|" Okay, girl. You're really good. No wonder you're Ladybug."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.734946250915527|" Alya, you can't do this to me!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.584922283887863|" No, you can't do this to Luka! You've been avoiding him for too long. You have to talk him. Just because you're not together doesn't mean you can't still be friends."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.504554957151413|" But it'll be so awkward! You know that Luka's in love with me, but I'm in love with Adrien, and every time we see each other, he just ends up getting hurt all over again because he knows I'll never feel the same."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.642232745885849|" Overdoing it a little?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.701929926872253|" He got akumatized twice because of me."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.413413286209106|" Yeah, but things are different this time! If that happens, once you— I mean, Ladybug, saves him and gives him the magical charm, he'll never get akumatized again! And then you guys can try to be friends again! You can't say no to that.It's your duty!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.293968796730042|" Uh... okay."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.0552821755409241|"Juleka! Hey! "
"Marinette"|"Juleka"|0.0103720426559448|" Psst! Psst! Psssst! Juleka!"
"Juleka"|"Marinette"|0.413301110267639|" Talking garbage can? Awesome!"
"Marinette"|"Juleka"|-0.539778172969818|"No, Juleka, it's me! I'm really sorry. I told Alya I'd come to your birthday and I thought there'll be no problems with Luka but... I really hate to ask this; but do you think you could arrange for Luka to, like, not go? "
"Juleka"|"Marinette"|-0.628176748752594|" Uhh..."
"Marinette"|"Juleka"|-0.642710089683533|" I know, it's his birthday, too, but it wouldn't exactly be a great birthday if the girl who broke his heart were there, right? I'd totally miss it if I could but Alya just won't drop it. You know, I feel terrible that I make Luka unhappy and that he got akumatized because of me. I don't think I could ever look him in the eyes again, and... and..."
"Juleka"|"Marinette"|0.564885973930359|"I'll see what I can do."
"Marinette"|"Juleka"|0.705343246459961|" Really! You'll talk to him? Oh, Juleka, you're the best! "
"Juleka"|"Luka"|0.570100426673889|"Hey, I'd like to have a party here with the gang on Saturday after all."
"Luka"|"Juleka"|0.580701470375061|"Great idea!"
"Juleka"|"Luka"|-0.316110610961914|" And actually, um... well... Marinette..."
"Luka"|"Luka"|0.00513875484466553|" Marinette will be there? Woah, I'm so relieved. I really thought she was avoiding me.That's cool, really! Super cool!"
"Luka"|"Juleka"|-0.261254966259003|" Was there something else?"
"Juleka"|"Luka"|-0.616688638925552|" No.No."
"Luka"|"Luka"|-0.286590218544006|"Juleka, I know that look. You're holding back something in there. That needs to come out."
"Luka"|"Jagged Stone"|-0.217012107372284|" Dad? "
"Jagged Stone"|"Luka and Jagged"|0.445082545280457|" Luka! Hey, son! How's it strumming? "
"Luka and Jagged"|"Juleka"|0.475237369537354|" Rock and roll!"
"Juleka"|"Jagged Stone"|0.0404956340789795|"Hi. "
"Jagged Stone"|"Anarka"|0.66612982749939|" Ready for the chord of the day, my boy? The diminished D7. I use it in all my tear-jerking ballads."
"Anarka"|"Jagged Stone"|-0.400472581386566|"Jagged Stone, you scallywag! No stowaways on my ship! Disembark my house right this instant!"
"Jagged Stone"|"Anarka"|0.242467880249023|"Hey, Anarka! Rock and roll! How'd you know I was here? I was being so sneaky!"
"Anarka"|"Jagged Stone"|-0.757518634200096|" \"Sneaky\"?? Your tour bus is parked on the dock, you one-hit wonder!"
"Jagged Stone"|"Anarka"|-0.729059487581253|" Nanarky, you can't keep me from teaching the diminished D7 to my son!"
"Anarka"|"Luka"|-0.528638780117035|" I appreciate you trying to create a bond with your children, Jagged. But no one sets foot on my houseboat without the captain's permission, and that captain is me!"
"Luka"|"Jagged Stone"|0.219653129577637|" Well then, Mom, uh, with your permission, could Dad come to our birthday on Saturday? Juleka wants to throw a party."
"Jagged Stone"|"Anarka"|-0.101647198200226|"Hey, Juleka! Rock and roll! I didn't see you there."
"Anarka"|"Juleka"|0.0998986959457397|" Juleka, you really want this old pirate to be at your birthday?"
"Juleka"|"Jagged Stone"|-0.202406823635101|" I— um...Yes."
"Jagged Stone"|"Alya"|0.672472715377808|"Awesome! See you on Saturday then!Rock and roll! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.719973564147949|"So, Juleka, everything good? Luka will be there, right?"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.284603714942932|"Hey, Juleka! Everything good? Luka won't be there, right?"
"Luka"|"Alya"|0.712338924407959|"I'm so happy that everyone will be there! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.710692167282104|" Marinette, I have to say that I'm really impressed with you. I never thought you'd be so chill about seeing Luka again.See how brave Marinette's being, Juleka?"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.730324625968933|" It's nothing. You gotta get over things in life. Grow up a bit.Sorry again. We're asking to do this but thanks for getting Luka out of here, Juleka. I couldn't handle this otherwise. Is he okay, by the way? I hope he didn't take it too hard— AHHH! "
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.244926333427429|" Hey, Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.282200336456299|"Excuse me! Sorry! I've got something to do! It's super urgent! Yep! Bye!I'm okay!"
"Luka"|"Rose"|-0.786577269434929|"Is something wrong with Marinette?"
"Rose"|"Alya"|-0.200823426246643|" What's going on, Jul?"
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.109509825706482|" Where is she going?"
"Nino"|"Alix"|-0.626324683427811|" Is there a problem?"
"Alix"|"Ivan"|-0.355962574481964|" Is she okay?"
"Ivan"|"Juleka"|-0.761037707328796|" What's wrong with her?"
"Juleka"|"Rose"|-0.298401594161987|"It's just that... I— um— oh...! "
"Rose"|"Luka"|0.14716911315918|" Jul!"
"Luka"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.740362167358398|"I knew it. Marinette doesn't want to have anything to do with me, and Juleka didn't have the heart to tell me. "
"Shadow Moth"|"Alya"|-0.0424466133117676|" The cruel disillusion of a young man who hoped that a friendship with a faded love could be rekindled.Fly away, my little akuma! Go evilize that heart!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.65997850894928|" Luka, come on. It's not like that!"
"Nino"|"Zoé"|-0.219671130180359|" You know how she gets around awkward situations."
"Zoé"|"Rose"|-0.688163071870804|" She doesn't hate you. She's just... Marinette."
"Rose"|"Ivan"|-0.640370696783066|" And she wouldn't say anything because she didn't want to hurt you."
"Ivan"|"Alix"|-0.344777166843414|" She was trying to protect you."
"Alix"|"Luka"|0.585968017578125|" Everyone loves you here!"
"Luka"|"Shadow Moth"|0.556449294090271|" Thanks, guys, for everything."
"Shadow Moth"|"Marinette"|-0.500965565443039|"How strange. The negative feelings have disappeared. But stay where you are, my little akuma. The party with teenagers always makes for a party of strong emotions. "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.693998962640762|"Juleka!"
"Marinette"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.615753829479218|" Why is he here?You couldn't tell him, could you?"
"Shadow Moth"|"Marinette"|-0.767865687608719|"A young girl disappointed in herself and wrecked with guilt! "
"Marinette"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.577449917793274|" Of course, you couldn't tell him. I asked you to do the impossible. I'm so sorry, Juleka. "
"Shadow Moth"|"Jagged Stone"|-0.116431057453156|"Again? What's going on?"
"Jagged Stone"|"Luka"|0.716840863227844|" Hey, kids! Everything jammin'?"
"Luka"|"Jagged Stone"|0.321687579154968|" Hi, Dad!"
"Jagged Stone"|"Alya"|-0.534742325544357|" Sorry I'm tardy to the party, son. You have any wrapping paper I could borrow?"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.0917196869850159|" Hang on. Jagged Stone..."
"Nino"|"Rose"|0.512111663818359|" ...is the father of..."
"Rose"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.448565006256104|" ...Luka and Juleka?"
"Shadow Moth"|"Ivan"|0.0912779569625854|"A group of friends surprised to find out that two of them have been keeping secrets."
"Ivan"|"Shadow Moth"|0.694640517234802|" That's... so... awesome!!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Juleka"|-0.453964114189148|"Yes, well, I should've guessed."
"Juleka"|"Marinette"|0.706037521362305|" Oh, yeah. He's my dad."
"Marinette"|"Jagged Stone"|-0.675318747758865|" What?? Jagged Stone is your father?Why would you think he doesn't love you and likes your brother better?"
"Jagged Stone"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.163159728050232|" You'll see, she's a real beauty! A sound that'll make your head spin.So you better hide it, okay?And not a word to your sister! "
"Shadow Moth"|"Marinette"|-0.727308183908463|"Ah, a young girl whose biggest fears have come true!And what could be worse than not being loved by your own father."
"Marinette"|"Jagged Stone"|-0.766752377152443|" Hang on, Juleka. I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding. You need to talk to your dad. That's how problems get solved.Jagged!"
"Jagged Stone"|"Marinette"|-0.623125314712524|"Marinette! "
"Marinette"|"Jagged Stone"|-0.670284032821655|"Hi, Luka! Yes, I know we need to talk, and we will, but don't worry. But right now, I need to talk to your dad! Jagged, you can't just give an amazing electric guitar to your son and nothing......nothing......and nothing to your daughter!"
"Jagged Stone"|"Juleka"|0.651893258094788|"Hey, thanks a lot for your incredible discretion, Marinette. Rock and roll. Actually, this was supposed to be a surprise gift for Juleka. Juleka plays bass for Kitty Section, right? So I thought it'd be cool if I gave her the very first bass I ever owned.Happy birthday, Juleka."
"Juleka"|"Jagged Stone"|0.612814664840698|" Thank you!"
"Jagged Stone"|"Anarka"|0.738653898239136|" And of course, I've got a present for my two kids. My gift for Luka was this original edition of the first LP from Crocoduo, the group I had with their mom.Happy birthday, Luka."
"Anarka"|"Jagged Stone"|-0.56806606054306|" Jagged Stone, you really are a shipwrecker. How dare you come here and give my son the album that caused our break-up?!"
"Jagged Stone"|"Anarka"|-0.623427987098694|" \"Caused our break-up\"?? You mean the album to help me get my life back after you left me!"
"Anarka"|"Jagged Stone"|-0.769835010170937|"You got a lot of nerve, pirate! You were the one who left me! "
"Jagged Stone"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.655974268913269|" No, you were!!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.658307194709778|"Finally! Two fractured lovers full of resentment and anger!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Marinette"|0.515985131263733|"Crocoduel, I am Shadow Moth. I'm giving you the power to get back together, to better tear each other apart! You finally have the chance to prove to the other that you were right. All I ask in return is that one of you bring me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous. May the best rocker win!"
"Marinette"|"Captain Hardrock"|-0.362186670303345|" Everybody, get out of the boat! Quick!"

But I threw it away!\"Your hair shines like the sun, your eyes are gorgeous green, I look at you and wonder your innermost thoughts and dreams.

"Plagg"|"Alya"|-0.152821779251099|" Oh, please."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.588289827108383|" What do you mean, you don't remember? Did you sign the card or not?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.76562362909317|" I don't know! The ladybug came along while I was writing, then you were yapping about your blog, and then... It's all a blur!"
"Alya"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.754541307687759|"I don't believe you! The girl didn't even sign it! I love you and all, but sometimes you seriously bug! You know that, right?"
"Nadja"|"Marinette"|0.337639808654785|"Ladybug and Cat Noir have saved Paris yet again. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.215354323387146|"And yet again, Marinette hopes she'll finally have enough time to complete her magic box. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.403373718261719|" What's the magic box for, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.33884871006012|" To lock up my diary, and all my secrets."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.135650396347046|" Every little secret? You're telling me that you write everything down in that thing?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.775324612855911|" Uh... yeah, something wrong?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.33817994594574|" Well, for one, what if someone finds out you're Ladybug? And two, what if someone finds out you're Ladybug?!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.534652501344681|" Not gonna happen. Try it, Tikki."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.313398241996765|"Hey!"
"Marinette"|"Nadja"|0.696545124053955|" And... it works! "
"Nadja"|"Marinette"|0.377042889595032|"Yesterday, Mr. Bourgeois was re-elected as mayor of Paris for the fourth consecutive term. Here we see Mr. Bourgeois with his daughter."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.301616668701172|" Ugh! Look at Chloé, acting as if she were the mayor of Paris! Oh! Which reminds me, Class Representative Elections are tomorrow!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.646965801715851|" What's so bad about that?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.216396927833557|" Chloé is running for class rep. The one person who cares the least about the students, and the most about herself. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.279681205749512|" Well then, maybe you should run! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.0721418261528015|" I totally would, but, don't you think I got enough to do with my duties as Ladybug and all my school work?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.473187804222107|" Yes, but, if you truly believe in something, you have to try and make it work. It's better to fail trying than not having tried at all!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.081684410572052|" Maybe..."
"Tikki"|"Nadja"|-0.258326470851898|" Don't underestimate yourself, Marinette! "
"Nadja"|"Marinette"|-0.556784719228745|"Armand D'Argencourt, one of Bourgeois's opponents, and fencing instructors of Françoise Dupont High School, was pummeled in the polls. In fact, D'Argencourt acquired the least number of votes in Paris History. "
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.372296214103699|" I'm going to be late for school! Again! See, this is what I'm talking about! "
"Miss Bustier"|"Chloé and Sabrina"|0.554869294166565|" Chloé is running for the class representative position and Sabrina will be her deputy. Do we have any other candidates? "
"Chloé and Sabrina"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.413255751132965|" Hm!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Kim"|-0.155899047851562|" Yes, Kim?"
"Kim"|"Marinette"|-0.718996554613113|" Um, er... nothing."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.631878912448883|" Hi! I'm sorry! I-uh, I-uh, the bus, , dry throat!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.236727952957153|" Chloé's running again! She's been class rep since when? Kindergarten? "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.414937734603882|" Oh! Why don't you run as candidate? You'd make an awesome representative! "
"Alya"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.256831228733063|" No can do. My blog is a full-time job! "
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|0.738558769226074|" Alright, I'll give all of you till the end of lunch to decide if you like to be a candidate."
"Marinette"|"Kim"|0.698133826255798|"So what did Chloé say to you this time? She offered to go on a date with you?"
"Kim"|"Rose"|-0.663320809602737|" No, she threatened to tell everyone I'm afraid of spiders."
"Rose"|"Alix"|0.236258625984192|" She told me that if I ran for the election, I'd get kicked out of scrapbooking club, and you know how much I love all those stickers, colorful scraps of papers, and gluing!"
"Alix"|"Marinette"|-0.518495082855225|" I couldn't care less about being a candidate, and what's your excuse?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.655371993780136|" Well, uh, um, I'm... really busy! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.584691345691681|" With what? Oversleeping?"
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.610280007123947|" Well, No! But, uh, well, I guess I would run if no one else did."
"Miss Bustier"|"Miss Bustier"|0.292380094528198|" So, any new candidates who would like to run against Chloé and Sabrina?"
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|-0.321210384368896|" Given that Chloé and Sabrina are the only candidates, there's no point in voting. So, Chloé and Sabrina..."
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.50161412358284|"I'll run!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Alya"|0.751962780952454|"Wonderful! You'll need to develop your campaign and have a speech ready by tomorrow. We'll have the vote then."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.67192006111145|" So, let's hear the scoop on your campaign! How are you gonna represent?"
"Marinette"|"Rose"|-0.066967248916626|" Represent? Uh, I have no idea. I still can't believe I raised my hand..."
"Rose"|"Marinette"|0.740562677383423|" Way to go, Marinette! You spoke from the heart, it was truly authentic! "
"Marinette"|"Rose"|-0.324895322322845|" Huh? Oh, uh... Thanks."
"Rose"|"Nino"|-0.0462555289268494|" When you win, can we get more comfortable chairs? They're so hard, I can barely concentrate in class.Maybe pink ones!"
"Nino"|"Juleka"|0.586405754089355|" And it'd be primo if we could listen to our beats while we study in the library."
"Juleka"|"Marinette"|-0.201226770877838|" Uh, you know... um, I don't-, you know."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.0513427257537842|" Um...Sure, Juleka."
"Alya"|"Adrien"|0.648199677467346|"Adrien! Marinette can count on your vote, right?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.548845291137695|" Sure, depending on her speech. "
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.635623097419739|"Better get cracking on that campaign. "
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|0.559492945671082|"I've watched how my daddy wins every election, and I'm going to follow in his footsteps. I know just how to win!"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|0.645430326461792|" By having the best campaign?"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.49903017282486|" Ha! Whatever! The secret to winning in politics is ruining your opponent's reputation!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.158351421356201|" Softer chairs, music in the library, whatever Juleka said... I'm writing down everyone's issues! Now I just have to get all this in my election speech."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.623964667320251|" I'm proud of you, I'm sure you're gonna win! You'll make an awesome class rep!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.722345978021622|" They're all relying on me to defeat Chloé. Even Adrien, do you realize that?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.538528591394424|"Marinette, battle's on."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.693738639354706|" Why? What's going on?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.580663084983826|" Chloé's invited the whole class to her campaign launch party at City Hall and she's got Jagged Stone coming, too!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.523329615592957|" Seriously? Jagged Stone, my favorite star?! I love him! Oh, and so does everyone else."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.0528852939605713|" Precisely! She's trying to buy student votes with autographs!"
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|-0.409181356430054|" Not if I have anything to say about it! Meet you there!"
"Sabrina"|"Sabine"|-0.250971853733063|" I'm going in, Chloé. "
"Sabine"|"Sabrina"|0.0623084306716919|" Hello!"
"Sabrina"|"Sabine"|-0.309859454631805|" Hi there! Marinette borrowed my math book for our Geometry homework, but I need it back."
"Sabine"|"Sabrina"|-0.135086536407471|" Marinette's not here, uh, I've got customers to attend to, but go on up and grab it from her room if you don't mind."
"Sabrina"|"Adrien"|0.641255378723145|" I'd be glad to, thanks!"
"Adrien"|"Armand"|-0.727131277322769|" Wow, Mr. D'Argencourt, never seen you on fire like this! That was some attack!"
"Armand"|"Adrien"|0.541372895240784|" It ought be. This particular maneuver hither was developed by my ancestor Darkblade."
"Adrien"|"Armand"|-0.514652073383331|" Darkblade?"
"Armand"|"Nadja"|0.195000410079956|" In the days of yore, Darkblade conquered Paris and ruled over it with an iron fist. Until he was overthrown vence by a wealthy Frenchman who used his dirty gold to buy the loyalties of the common people. To think that not so long ago, my ancestor's flag was waving above Paris..."
"Nadja"|"Armand"|-0.297426760196686|" Is that what you ran in the election, Mr. D'Argencourt? To seek revenge on your ancestors behalf?"
"Armand"|"Nadja"|0.56342613697052|" Part le fer! Who dost we have hither?"
"Nadja"|"Fred"|-0.360583186149597|" Nadja Chamack. Don't be bemused, it's just the news! Do you have anything to say about your quote un-quote landslide defeat?"
"Fred"|"Nadja"|-0.165787577629089|" Hey, you! Excuse me! How did you get in the school?"
"Nadja"|"Fred"|-0.205487608909607|" I think it's time to get back to the studio! "
"Fred"|"Armand"|0.444461107254028|" Get back here!"
"Armand"|"Hawk Moth"|0.382958292961121|" Here endeth the lesson."
"Hawk Moth"|"Nadja"|-0.778635859489441|"A loser and an utter failure in an election. But the perfect candidate to lobby my own campaign.Fly away, my evil little akuma, and take control of this defeated fighter!"
"Nadja"|"Armand"|-0.627563536167145|" Mr. D'Argencourt, it has been said, and I quote, that you're \"stuck in the dark ages like a stubborn old rusted battle-axe\". What do you have to say to that?"
"Armand"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.775750547647476|" Poisonous wretch! Darest thou approach with such venomous questions? Be gone now, pestilent pain in the neck! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Armand"|0.621480703353882|" Darkblade... In return for the powers I'm giving you, you'll capture Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous for me."

"Adrien"|" Adrien"|0.164726614952087|"Time to transform!"
" Adrien"|"Darkblade"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"

"Cat Noir"|"Darkblade"|0.211679577827454|" The people had their say and they chose Bourgeois over you, D'Argencourt!"
"Darkblade"|"Sabrina"|-0.70322784781456|" Thy peoples matter not to me. D'Argencourt was defeated, not Darkblade! En garde!"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|0.656540751457214|"Chloé, I made it in. So, what am I looking for?"
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.523575514554977|"Anything. As long as it's totally embarrassing."
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|0.323105335235596|"Wait, I had one just like this! How about... a ball of yarn! Or a screwdriver?"
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.684311598539352|" 'Course not, dingbat! A disgusting photo of her or some really tacky piece of clothing! Dig around a bit!"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|0.39537501335144|"Ohh... how about her diary?"
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|0.426664233207703|" Wow! You can actually accomplish something when you put my mind to it!"
"Chloé"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|-0.124892771244049|" Sabrina? Sabrina?!"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Chloé"|0.733190298080444|" I'm pleased to welcome you all to the official launch of Chloé's electoral campaign. And a special thank-you to world-famous pop-star Jagged Stone for endorsing her."

"Marinette"|"Nathaniel"|-0.703391522169113|" Do you realize that you're all being bribed? Concert tickets are awesome, but they aren't gonna solve classroom problems."

"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.4303297996521|" Well, um, I'm, um, thinking that cushions would be more realistic than buying new chairs.Your cushion could be very pink. And I'll see about listening to music in the library. Through headphones, of course."

"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.261228561401367|" Wasn't easy, but I'm glad I tried. Cause if I hadn't, I never would've known I could do it."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.440759003162384|" So where were you? Safely hiding under a rock?"

"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.780499398708344|" I told you, I never took her diary! And I'm offended that you're accusing me."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.15194833278656|" Then how did you even know my diary was in here?"
"Chloé"|"Nino"|0.331269145011902|" Oh, well, uh... Sabrina told me. It was all her idea!"

"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.376294136047363|" No, I'm not! I just wanna be voted in fairly, not because you don't wanna vote for Chloé, but because you believe in me! I'm not gonna make promises that I can't keep, and I'm not gonna be able to get you everything that you want. But I am resourceful and I know how to prioritize. I'm a good listener and a great multi-tasker. Representing you all is something I truly believe in. And most importantly, I believe in myself. So... Vote for Marinette, for class representative!"

"Rolland"|"Rolland"|-0.710457921028137|"Not with a dish cloth, son! That's not how it's done! "
"Rolland"|"Tom"|0.300230383872986|" It melts in the mouth!"
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.547000408172607|" And yet perfectly crispy!"
"Sabine"|"Rolland"|0.744784712791443|" It's delicious! Congratulations! It's the first recipe you've made together: your own father-and-son King's Day galette!"
"Rolland"|"Tom"|0.728031635284424|" The perfect alliance of tradition..."
"Tom"|"Tikki"|0.211509704589844|" And modernity! "

"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.272151112556458|"It's a galette. Made for King's Day. Every year, same day, same time, whoever finds the charm in their slice gets a to wear a golden paper crown.Go back to sleep, Tikki. It's too early for a Sunday. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.433417081832886|" But I've never smelled anything so sweet and wonderful! May I please go and try a little bit?"
"Marinette"|"Wayzz"|-0.668581783771515|" No, Tikki! No one can see you! "

"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.512785077095032|"Can I please have a tiny piece of galette?"
"Tom"|"Rolland"|0.683827877044678|" Marinette has always loved galettes! "
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.515671849250793|" That's not how it's done! The tradition is that first, we sell all the galettes we made,and then we get to enjoy the very last galette together as a family! Until then,all the galettes are for the customers."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.432349801063538|"Thanks, Dad! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.0588291883468628|" Where's the galette thing-y that's giving off that enchanting smell?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.280636668205261|" We have to wait until tonight for the galette, Tikki. But you can have some of this croissant while you wait!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.729955554008484|"I can't wait that long, Marinette! The smell is soooo extraordinary! I have to taste whatever it is, please, please, please?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.694589018821716|"Alright. I'll go try and get you a piece. I do want to try Dad and Grandpa's new galette! Hide, Tikki!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.105817317962646|" Um... I was just thinking, maybe I could help you by handing out little samples of the galette to the customers standing in the line outside! It'll help them stay patient!"
"Rolland"|"Rolland"|0.580701470375061|" Great idea!"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.779626250267029|" It's nice to see that young people still have a sense of service."

"Sass"|"Daizzi"|-0.71228039264679|" That's not what happened!"
"Daizzi"|"Tikki"|-0.530889391899109|" Tikki ate them all up!"

"The rest of the Kwamis"|"Marinette"|0.210172057151794|" Oh, that's right!"
"Marinette"|"Sass"|-0.746763408184052|"You guys are joking! Tikki would never do such a thing!"
"Sass"|"Stompp"|-0.0134153366088867|" Marinette, you know how much Tikki loves to eat, but do you really understand the Kwami of Creation's appetite for food?"
"Stompp"|"Sass"|0.560870170593262|" It's a gourmet craving of cosmic dimensions!"
"Sass"|"Marinette"|0.560288548469543|" The pastry your father and his father created together is exceptional, unique. I'm afraid its impact on Tikki will—"
"Marinette"|"Sass"|-0.557356864213943|" You're exaggerating, Sass. It's just a galette."
"Sass"|"Marinette"|-0.446298241615295|" I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but I think you don't know Tikki as well as you think you do."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.712187886238098|" What?! Of course, I know her! I can say that I know her better than anyone! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.708811819553375|" Don't listen to them, Marinette! He's not worth getting upset about when it's so much easier just to go back and get some galette for everybody!"
"Marinette"|"Ziggy"|0.553066253662109|" You're absolutely right, Tikki! So, everyone just stay here like good kwamis and Tikki and I will be back soon with some galette for everyone! Okay?"
"Ziggy"|"Barkk"|-0.116190016269684|" We're never gonnaget to taste that sublime galette!"
"Barkk"|"Sass"|-0.189353287220001|" And we'll be lucky if that's the only consequence of the Great Sweet Tooth's appetite!"
"Sass"|"Tikki"|0.258633613586426|" Barkk, Wayzz, since this is an emergency, I'm giving you permission to go out. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.350351810455322|" I'm sorry. The distribution took so long and the galette samples smelled so good. "
"Marinette"|"André"|-0.649076282978058|" Don't worry, there'll be enough for everybody! There's no need to react like they did."
"André"|"Rolland"|0.697705626487732|"I promise to erect a statue in your honor in front of City Hall in exchange for your last galette!"

"Marinette"|"Gina"|-0.215093374252319|" Don't worry, Tikki. I'll put aside a piece for you and the others. "
"Gina"|"Tom"|0.671625733375549|" Happy birthday, Marinetta! "

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.343038320541382|" I'm really sorry, Marinette. I thought I'd never have one of those craving episodes again, but the galette your family created is really an exceptional event in the culinary history of humanity!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.379637539386749|"I don't blame you, Tikki. But what are we gonna do next year on Galette Day?"
"Tikki"|"Gina"|0.190812826156616|" I've given it some thought! I'm sure that I can reduce my cravings if I just eat galette more often!"
"Gina"|"Rolland"|-0.658757328987122|" Marinetta, we're really sorry. We got all into an argument about this bike."
"Rolland"|"Tom"|0.503822684288025|" Because each of us thought we knew what was right for you."
"Tom"|"Sabine"|-0.509170383214951|" But none of us thought to ask..."
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.307636618614197|" ...how you were feeling about it."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.614895701408386|" Actually, you all know me pretty well! This bike will be awesome, in a few years. However, I'd be super excited to have an electric mini scooter!"
"Tom"|"Sabine"|-0.482811748981476|" Uh— A scooter's okay but with a helmet, right?"
"Sabine"|"Gabriel"|-0.598151445388794|" See, I told you she would be solo."
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|0.323290824890137|" Emilie, my queen, Ladybug and Cat Noir escaped me again today, but I will never give up. I will get their Miraculous. Thanks to the all powerful forces of destruction and creation, I'll destroy this world that took you from us to build a new one, where we'll never be apart again. I will succeed, Emilie. Whatever the cost."
"Tom"|"Alya"|0.470529556274414|" I'll let you in on a little secret. I always add cream to the chocolate to make the ganache extra velvety. Then I let infuse for one minute."

"Chloé"|"Rose"|-0.418617129325867|" Urgh! Do they seriously think I'm going to get my hands dirty, cooking like some maid? If I want a croissant, I'd just make my butler get it for me."
"Rose"|"Tom"|-0.587804794311523|" He's not making croissants, Chloé. Those are macarons!"
"Tom"|"Chloé"|-0.426363110542297|" It's all done with a flick of the wrist. But you mustn't go too fast or you might splash yourself!"

"Tom"|"Rose"|0.767669796943665|" Look at this lovely emulsion."
"Rose"|"Tom"|0.6651850938797|" It's beautiful!"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.439363837242126|" Now we need to chill it for half an hour. Marinette? "

"Miss Bustier"|"Student"|-0.336657106876373|" Quietly, students. Single file line, please. Just keep moving."
"Student"|"Tom"|-0.594586044549942|" Excuse me."
"Tom"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.489565968513489|" I hope it's only a fire drill."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Fireman"|-0.333656787872314|" So, some smart aleck had the bright idea of calling the fire department.Somebody amongst us thought it would be funny to waste the fire captain's valuable time."
"Fireman"|"Marinette"|0.619922637939453|" Yes, in fact, if you wouldn't mind I..."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.425387680530548|"I'm sure it was Chloé. I saw her on her phone right before the alarm went off!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.320798754692078|" You seeing her make a phone call isn't solid proof. "
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Chloé"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.434955835342407|" Mr. Damocles, sir?"

"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.352040469646454|" I saw a student leaving the classroom right before the alarm went off. It must have been her."
"Chloé"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.418843269348145|" Let's see if she'll come clean. What do you say, Marinette Dupain-Cheng? "
"Mr. Damocles"|"Adrien"|0.43526828289032|" Marinette, do you have something to tell the firefighter captain?"
"Adrien"|"Alya"|-0.700515270233154|" Urgh, wait. Excuse me, sir!It couldn't possibly be Marinette. Why would she disrupt her own father's cooking class?"
"Alya"|"Fireman"|-0.429806053638458|" And I know for a fact that Marinette didn't even have her phone on her when she went out of the classroom."
"Fireman"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.334099888801575|" Mr. Damocles, I must be heading out."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Chloé"|0.369479894638062|" Just one more second. We're very close to discovering the truth."

"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.54147943854332|" I'm not gonna let her get away with this. I've gotta tell..."

"Alya"|"Fireman"|-0.737202197313309|" He's right. Let's not stoop to her level."
"Fireman"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.161497831344604|" I really have to leave now. Just call me if you find out who the prankster is. "
"Mr. Damocles"|"Chloé"|-0.675938576459885|" Fine. Since no one is owning up, the whole school will be punished. "
"Chloé"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.595561414957047|" What?! I'm not so sure my father will react kindly to me being punished without any proof! gets out her phone, preparing to call her dad"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Chloé"|-0.750248774886131|"Oh, no! Please, don't disrupt the busy mayor.The whole school is punished except for Miss Bourgeois! "
"Chloé"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.264610528945923|" That's more like it."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Fireman"|-0.645938128232956|" Now you know how we deal with anyone who misuses the fire department's time."

"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.199505567550659|" I know. Adrien just talked in my ear!"

"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.759426236152649|" Adrikins!"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|-0.211167454719543|" Of course it was me who called the fire department. So what?"
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|-0.745892316102982|" And it doesn't bother you that everyone's being punished because of you?"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|-0.424878180027008|" No. Why would it? They all seem to enjoy getting dirty making cookies. How's it any different than getting dirty, cleaning floors? They should be thanking me if anything. "
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.503052115440369|"Chloé, how long have you and I been friends?"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|0.458076000213623|" Since we were adorable little tots, Adrikins. "
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|-0.701682835817337|"Well, I'm sorry Chloé, but I can't be friends with someone who treats other people like this. You've gotta be nice to people!"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|-0.727502137422562|" N-Nice?"
"Adrien"|"Jean"|0.645375490188599|" Yes, nice. It's not that hard."
"Jean"|"Chloé"|-0.598128795623779|" Mademoiselle does not look very happy, today. "
"Chloé"|"Jean"|-0.653338402509689|" Adrien says I have to be nice to everyone or he won't be my friend anymore! How can he do this to me, Jean-Michel?"
"Jean"|"Jean"|0.344966650009155|" Uh, my name is... hm, never mind. Ah, perhaps Mademoiselle can see comfort with Mr. Cuddly?"
"Jean"|"Chloé"|0.675078511238098|" If you would allow it, Mademoiselle, I could help you keep your friendship with Adrien."
"Chloé"|"Jean"|-0.688789784908295|" W-why would you do a thing like that, Jean-Jacques?"
"Jean"|"Jean"|0.622522830963135|" Because that's what being nice is all about, Mademoiselle. "
"Jean"|"Chloé"|0.343246221542358|" I'm sure Mademoiselle can remember when she was a little girl when Mr. Cuddly was always nice to Mademoiselle when she was sad. Mr. Cuddly can teach you how to be kind to others!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.718814015388489|"I remember, Jean-Luc. Adrien's going to see just how nice I can be."
"Marinette"|"Rose"|0.596664071083069|" And these are jewels I designed that you can customize yourselves."
"Rose"|"Alya"|0.633502006530762|" Oooh. They are so cute."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.130445837974548|" Hold on, nobody move.This one would make an awesome homepage image for your future blog. Wouldn't it?Chloé?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.19821685552597|" What does that bratty snob want?"
"Alya"|"Rose"|0.414154887199402|" Chloé's inviting me to a party."

"Rose"|"Marinette"|0.72328770160675|" That's so nice of Chloé!"
"Marinette"|"Mylène"|0.570395469665527|" Chloé and nice in the same sentence? Can't be her."
"Mylène"|"Marinette"|-0.56530898809433|" Maybe somebody hacked her phone then."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.70034122467041|"I haven't received a text."
"Alya"|"Chloé"|0.280111193656921|" Then that means it must be from Chloé! "

"Jean"|"Marinette"|0.667707681655884|" It's what Mr. Cuddly would do, yes."

"Rose"|"Marinette"|0.593532919883728|" Awesome! This will be so much fun!"
"Marinette"|"Mylène"|-0.288639843463898|" Wait! You're actually going to go?"
"Mylène"|"Marinette"|-0.124693155288696|" She probably wants to say sorry for this morning. Maybe's she's nice. Very, very, deep down."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.621847748756409|" Chloé? No, she's the exact opposite of nice! Whatever, you guys can go but don't count me in."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.104122877120972|" It's Nino. He's going to the party with Adrien."
"Marinette"|"Hawk Moth"|0.0263609886169434|"O-okay, yes, you guys are right! We should totally give Chloé one more chance!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Jean"|-0.718150079250336|" A party being thrown by the most spiteful girl in all of Paris? Such a fertile breeding ground for negative emotions!Fly away, my evil akuma! Finding a victim to evilize should be a piece of cake!"
"Jean"|"Chloé"|0.724059700965881|" Mademoiselle should go downstairs and greet her guests in a welcoming manner with a hug and a kiss."
"Chloé"|"Jean"|-0.451270759105682|" Uh, you're kidding, Jean-Claude. You really expect me to let their cheeks touch mine?"
"Jean"|"Marinette"|0.751499652862549|" Well, that's what Mr. Cuddly would do.This way, you will prove to your good friend, Adrien that you really are nice."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.303896307945251|" This whole party thing is way weird."
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.682660222053528|" Well, I've known Chloé for a long time. She can be really cool, sometimes!"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|0.821709513664246|"Adrikins!What do you think of me hosting this party? Really nice of me, right? "
"Adrien"|"Rose"|0.601710915565491|" It's awesome, Chloé! "

"Max"|"Alya"|0.593305826187134|"Thanks for the invite, Chloé. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.609238266944885|"I should have got you guys on video!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.664467871189117|"Don't rub it in."
"Chloé"|"Jean"|0.588191866874695|" I did it. Adrien seems happy. Are we done now?"
"Jean"|"Chloé"|0.750468254089355|" If I may be so bold, in order to reaffirm Adrien of her kindness, Mademoiselle might go and check that her guests are having a good time."
"Chloé"|"Jean"|-0.654541909694672|" And why would I do that, Jean-Marc?"
"Jean"|"Chloé"|0.0348540544509888|" Because that's what Mr. Cuddly would do!"

"Chloé"|"Mylène"|0.795315861701965|"Having a good time?"
"Mylène"|"Chloé"|-0.260178029537201|" Whoa! All this dancing's made me thirsty. Do you know where the ice cubes are?"
"Chloé"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.305025100708008|" How should I know? I'm not your servant! Go and find them yourself! And if you're so hot, why don't you take off your fake sheep skin sweater? Throw it in the trash where it belongs!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Jean"|0.167184948921204|"I knew I wouldn't have to wait very long!"
"Jean"|"Chloé"|-0.6802758872509|" Ahem!"
"Chloé"|"Hawk Moth"|0.423536777496338|"I'm totally joking. I love mutton! I'll get you those ice cubes! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Marinette"|-0.457656025886536|"What are you doing, Miss Bourgeois? Where's that natural cruelty I'm counting on?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.324746310710907|" This BFF act she's doing is just one big charade. She's just doing it to please Adrien."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.706286489963531|" Ahem. How funny. That reminds me of a girl who didn't want to go to a party until she heard she heard Adrien would be there."
"Marinette"|"Kim"|-0.503994822502136|" Please don't compare me to Chloé. "
"Kim"|"Chloé"|0.634691596031189|" Chloé, how about a dance with an awesome guy?"
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|0.553427457809448|" I'd love it! Where is he?"
"Chloé"|"Alya"|0.327756524085999|" Oh! Here is, right in front of me. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.251763701438904|" Go over and ask him, girl!"

"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.678983807563782|" Hey, Marinette. Wanna dance?"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.497823238372803|"I, uh..."
"Chloé"|"Kim"|-0.571567118167877|"What?! I am speechless!"
"Kim"|"Adrien"|0.562154769897461|" Thanks! You're a pretty good dancer, yourself."
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.60347044467926|" See? Chloé's on her best behavior tonight."
"Chloé"|"Kim"|-0.699867218732834|" I'm not letting her dance with Adrien under my roof!"
"Kim"|"Jean"|0.411156177520752|" Hey, this song's not over yet!"
"Jean"|"Chloé"|0.378046870231628|" If I re-say, Mademoiselle, or to..."
"Chloé"|"Jean"|-0.372341811656952|" Move, Jean-Jacques!"
"Jean"|"Kim"|0.643094539642334|" Oh, please, Chloé, dear! You've been such a good little girl! Mr. Cuddly is so very proud..."
"Kim"|"Chloé"|0.29519522190094|" Is that your teddy bear, Chloé?"
"Chloé"|"Jean"|-0.681067854166031|" I've had it with your stupid teddy bear, your stupid advice, and you, Jean, whatever your stupid name is!"
"Jean"|"Chloé"|-0.62254536151886|" But, Mademoiselle, I was only trying to help."
"Chloé"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.712551414966583|" There's no more Mademoiselle, no more help, no more anything! You are FIRED! Now get out!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.656269669532776|"Ah, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Jean"|-0.507962197065353|" Hello, Despair Bear. I am Hawk Moth. You've always been such a good influence on Chloé, but now, you get to be a bad influence for everyone, and a very evil one at that. "

"Despair Bear"|"Sabrina"|-0.787449464201927|" You've been very naughty, Chloékins! And Despair Bear is not proud of you. The time has come to make you pay!"

"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|-0.522786051034927|" Let me brush your hair! I promise I won't hurt you!"
"Chloé"|"Kim"|-0.666512966156006|" Ahh! Somebody stop her!"
"Kim"|"Despair Bear"|-0.181557714939117|" If you touch one hair on Chloé's head, you'll have to answer to me."
"Despair Bear"|"Marinette"|0.2278071641922|" Oh, what a gentleman. Despair Bear praises a knight in shining armor. "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.324653625488281|" Uh, I think I had too much orange juice. I gotta go. See ya."
"Adrien"|"Sabrina"|0.396303534507751|" No problem. I have something to do, anyway. See ya."
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|-0.436493813991547|" Chloé?"

"Chloé"|"Kim"|-0.03933185338974|" Kim, do something!"
"Kim"|"Marinette"|0.532669425010681|" Would you like to dance, Chloé?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.396317422389984|" I... I've gotta transform, Tikki. Too bad I had to stop dancing with Adrien. It felt like I was dancing on a little cloud. I'm out of body experience. It was like..."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.142647802829742|" Marinette, focus. "
"Marinette"|" Marinette"|0.159393310546875|" Okay, back down to Earth."

"Jean"|"Chloé"|-0.508941382169724|" Mademoiselle, I must confess. I don't remember anything!"
"Chloé"|"Cat Noir"|-0.444641292095184|" Well, basically, you turned evil and I saved you. In fact, without me, Ladybug and Cat Noir would never have succeeded. I'm even better than you superheroes. I don't even need a costume."

"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.691652655601501|" That was a great idea of inviting Marinette's dad!"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|-0.337536573410034|" I know. This way, no one can be mad at me for calling the fire department. I'm really nice now, did you notice, Adrikins? Even Ladybug said so! Didn't she, Jean-Pascal?"
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.425958037376404|" I'm proud of you, Chloé. I think you've proven that you're capable of making an effort to be nicer to everyone."
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|0.610565185546875|" Aww, Adrikins! So we'll always be best friends, forever? Pinky swear?"
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|-0.678742587566376|" Pinky swear!"

"Desperada"|"Marinette"|0.539243936538696|" In that case, you'll be my first choice too!I never miss a musical note. Vivica ALWAYS hits her targets!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.304822683334351|" I never should've given that guitar to Adrien. Why did I do that, Tikki?"

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir's voice"|-0.508747100830078|" I appreciate it, but when you're dealing with a supervillain, it's better to have a partner with superpowers. Speaking of which..."
"Cat Noir's voice"|"Ladybug"|-0.0354633331298828|"Cat got your tongue? Leave a message. "
"Ladybug"|"Luka"|0.48602294921875|" Okay."

"Desperada"|"Ladybug"|0.159919857978821|" I'll find that brat guitarist sooner or later, Ladybug!"
"Ladybug"|"Luka"|0.440398931503296|" I can handle this. Could I... borrow that, please?"
"Luka"|"Ladybug"|0.53080952167511|" You know how to play?"
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.428696990013123|" Let's just say I have my own personal style. Meanwhile, find a place to hide. Both of you!"
"Adrien"|"Luka"|-0.331352829933167|" You can hide in here. It's a bit tight for the two of us. I'll go in another one."
"Luka"|"Plagg"|0.644068241119385|" Okaysee you later."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.114519894123077|" How about a little nap while we wait for Ladybug to come back?"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.205233693122864|" No, it's time for Cat Noir to make his entrance."
"Adrien"|"Desperada"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Desperada"|"Desperada"|-0.717076182365417|" Ugh! Who is torturing that poor guitar?!"
"Desperada"|"Master Fu"|0.659985303878784|" That's better."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.628286838531494|" Marinette Dupain-Cheng. You must pick an ally you can trust to fight alongside you on this mission. Once the mission is over, you will take the Miraculous back and return it to me."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.710941970348358|" Desperada's relentless. There's no room for error with herthere'll be no second chance. Or maybe this one."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.038590669631958|" The snake's power is a very strong one, Marinette. Whoever uses it must be wise enough, not to be tempted to manipulate time for their own personal gain. "
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.520580410957336|" I understand, Master Fu, I know just the perfect person. I can't believe I didn't think of him beforea perfect match."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.589512526988983|" We must stop running into each other like this, M'lady. Let's take care of this guitarist and her seriously bad music. Uh, you lookin' for something, M'lady?"

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.48212993144989|" You wanna entrust him with a Miraculous?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.733276963233948|" You're not supposed to know, but, yeah! He's the perfect guy for this mission."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.493212103843689|" You know, you can trust me and my incredible nose. If Adrien's down here, I'll find him for you. Adrien's in there."
"Ladybug"|"Luka"|-0.768916711211205|" Your incredible nose failed you this time."
"Luka"|"Cat Noir"|-0.577783048152924|" Cat Noir. Ladybug. Have you defeated Desperada yet? Oh, where's Adrien?"
"Cat Noir"|"Adrien"|-0.624410063028336|" Um, maybe he took off and hid somewhere else. Let's split up and find him. Hide in there for the mean time. Claws in! "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.585600018501282|" Plagg, Ladybug needs me. She needs \"Adrien\"!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.663354992866516|" If you asked me, this whole idea is worse than cheese in a can."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.673496842384338|" She thinks I'm the perfect guy for this mission."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.0325366258621216|" You can't be Cat Noir and another superhero at the same time! Which means that you're not the perfect guy for this mission."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.725347280502319|" The Lucky Charm told her I am."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.718093991279602|" That's not how it works. Why am I bothering? You're not even listening."
"Adrien"|"Ladybug "|0.652352213859558|" This is my chance to get her to love me as myself! \"Adrien\"! I don't care what costume comes with it, I have to try. Ladybug chose me!"

"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.552852630615234|" Yeah. I was just hiding a bit further down. I thought it'd be better if Desperada couldn't find us both in the same place."
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|0.523868083953857|" I need you."
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.26269668340683|" Me?"

"Viperion"|"Ladybug"|0.0126492977142334|" No need. Ladybug brings enough luck for all of us. "

"Ladybug"|"Jagged Stone"|0.0229637622833252|" You were the right choice, Luka. I'm sure we'll see each other again soon. Bug out!"
"Jagged Stone"|"Vivica"|-0.501578748226166|" I know I wasn't very rock 'n' roll to you, Vivica. And even if you did eat my cereal and drink Fang's milk, I should've never fired you that way. You can come back if you want, but get your own breakfast, okay?"

"Jagged Stone"|"Kagami"|-0.730704635381699|"Besides, I get why Anarka no longer wants to play with me. And I respect her decision, what's past is past, isn't that right, Nanarky? "
"Kagami"|"Alya"|-0.668753355741501|" I was wrong about you and Luka, wasn't I? But you'd better hurry up and choose, Marinette. You don't always get a second chance when it comes to love."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.289735436439514|" Well, Adrien and Luka can choose too, right? And they haven't made their choice yet, either."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.530148148536682|" Emilie, everything I've done, I've done for you. And if I had to, I would do it again a hundred times."

"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.350447058677673|" But Father, you're launching your hundredth collection tonight! You're the one the journalists want to interview, not me."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.053374171257019|"Adrien, I am your father, and I am giving you the responsibility to attend this press conference. Under no circumstances will you leave that room until it's finished. All I'm asking is that you honor my work and the memory of your mother. Do we have an agreement?"

"Ladybug"|"Moolak"|-0.5221928358078|" I know! I already left I don't know how many messages for Cat Noir!"

"Viperion"|"Ladybug"|-0.524211406707764|" Scales rest. "
"Ladybug"|"Su-Han"|0.203492760658264|" Thanks, Luka—"
"Su-Han"|"Ladybug"|0.422211647033691|" This really takes the cake!"
"Ladybug"|"Su-Han"|0.376057386398315|" Grand Master Su-Han?"
"Su-Han"|"Ladybug"|-0.453902065753937|" Nine! You used nine Miraculouses to defeat a single villain, when Cat Noir could have just used his Cataclysm!"
"Ladybug"|"Su-Han"|-0.629310667514801|" I had to, Cat Noir was missing!"
"Su-Han"|"Ladybug"|-0.699598044157028|" What do you mean missing? You can't just let the holder of the most powerful Miraculous go about as he pleases! What if he started making his own decisions, or act it out? Like Shadow Moth!"
"Ladybug"|"Su-Han"|-0.533838093280792|" Cat Noir? Act like Shadow Moth? Wow. Are you blowing this out of proportion just a little?"
"Su-Han"|"Ladybug"|-0.625653207302094|" Not at all. In fact, you should find out who Cat Noir really is, so you can have better control over him."
"Ladybug"|"Su-Han"|-0.404989063739777|" What? No way! We can't know our true identities! It would be too dangerous if Shadow Moth got a hold of one of us!"
"Su-Han"|"Ladybug"|-0.58659416437149|" I. Don't. Care!! Deal with this problem quickly, otherwise I will take back his Miraculous as soon as he shows a whisker! And I'll choose the new Cat Noir myself!"
"Ladybug"|"Su-Han"|0.548076272010803|" Okay, okay, alright. What if you knew who he was, would that work?"
"Su-Han"|"Ladybug"|-0.249188661575317|" I... I suppose so. But I'm warning you, if you don't succeed..."
"Ladybug"|"Luka"|-0.585135668516159|" I get it. Cat Noir will be replaced."
"Luka"|"Ladybug"|0.0458468198776245|" Are you really going to do as he asks?"
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.479317426681519|" Do I really have a choice in the matter? I can't fight the Celestial Guardian, and I don't want the risk of losing our Cat Noir. I'm gonna need both of you."
"Adrien"|"Cat Noir"|-0.566493511199951|" I hope Ladybug didn't need me. Plagg, claws out! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.747063010931015|" Fourteen messages? She must be furious. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.672617316246033|"Finally! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.301180303096771|" I know what you're about to say, Ladybug, but—"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.34035724401474|"Nevermind! We got through it. That's all that matters. But we do need to talk. Meet me at the top of the Eiffel Tower."
"Cat Noir"|"Luka"|-0.539792746305466|"I get the feeling I'll have my whiskers yanked. "
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.0982811450958252|" I'm wondering, Ladybug. How do you plan to reveal Cat Noir's identity to Su-Han if you don't know who he is?"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.595755696296692|" Remember why you must all ignore who Cat Noir and I really are? "
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.71666407585144|" So Shadow Moth leaves us alone when we're not superheroes? If we don't know who you are, we're no interest to him."
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.65413236618042|" Yes. But in fact, if worse comes to worst, a Miraculous holder could know Cat Noir's identity or mine, but not both. "
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.195416390895844|" That way, there'd always be one of you to fight Shadow Moth!"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.405152559280396|" Exactly! But for Cat Noir and me, it's different. If we knew each other's identities, all would take is just for one of us to be akumatized to betray the other. "
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.0727256536483765|" And Shadow Moth would win."
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.554696828126907|" Tikki, spots on! "
"Luka"|"Ladybug"|-0.234572112560272|" Sass, scales slither! "
"Ladybug"|"Viperion"|0.437548995018005|" This is the plan: you stay here hidden. I ask Cat Noir his identity. He tells me..."
"Viperion"|"Ladybug"|0.669681787490845|" Since I'll hear everything, I'll also know his name."
"Ladybug"|"Viperion"|-0.249420940876007|" That's when you'll use your power of Second Chance to go back in time. I'll forget everything but you won't."
"Viperion"|"Ladybug"|0.4205082654953|" Or I could just ask him myself if you want. It'd be less dangerous that way, wouldn't it?"
"Ladybug"|"Viperion"|-0.464475154876709|"Cat Noir will only tell if I'm the one asking."
"Viperion"|"Ladybug"|0.500925540924072|" Alright, and then I'll tell the Celestial Guardian Cat Noir's identity."
"Ladybug"|"Viperion"|0.0907291173934937|" And then he'll finally got me some slack. "
"Viperion"|"Ladybug"|-0.25068336725235|" Are you sure the fact that I know who Cat Noir is won't be a problem?"
"Ladybug"|"Viperion"|-0.546257793903351|" Like I said, as long as I don't know who he is, everything will be fine."
"Viperion"|"Ladybug"|0.317664265632629|"Do you think Cat Noir would agree to this?"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.686939716339111|"He's been dying to tell me who he is for the longest time.There he is! Get ready!"
"Ladybug"|"Viperion"|0.640762329101562|" Now! We're in sync!"
"Viperion"|"Ladybug"|-0.128132224082947|" Second Chance!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.253464937210083|" The countdown has begun. It's 1 am, and we've got just five minutes before you transform back. So we've got to be done by 1:05. You'll rewind on my signal."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.680811256170273|"I'm sorry, but I really couldn't make it earlier."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.544824570417404|"Hey, no big deal! That's the good thing about a team. It's not the two of us anymore! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.108228325843811|" Oh, yeah! So then, why did you need me exactly?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.466480851173401|" Well... actually, it's kind of linked to what happened today. I've given it a lot of thought ever since I became guardian, you know?And, I've realized that... you were right after all.We should tell each other our secret identities. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.668644577264786|" But, aren't the secrets supposed to protect us?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.441717386245728|" I thought so. But when you didn't show up today, I didn't know how to locate you because we can't communicate when we're not transformed. If something bad happened to one of us when we're not heroes, we could know about it. It would make us stronger. We'd be able to defeat Shadow Moth quicker! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.374152660369873|"So, we're doing this, for real?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.299741506576538|" Yes."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.348522067070007|" Wow. Okay. You go ahead, m'lady. Guardians first!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.601328045129776|" No, you first. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.329734206199646|" Let's do it together."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.599900782108307|" No, I mean it. You go first. I'm... feeling kind of... awkward. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.16008049249649|" Fine. I'm... I'm... Adrien Agreste."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0443140268325806|"And I'm Audrey Bourgeois!You? Adrien Agreste? There's no way! You two aren't alike at all!"
"Cat Noir"|"Adrien"|-0.454914927482605|" Claws in. "
"Adrien"|"Viperion"|0.521077513694763|" See? It's really me, Adrien Agreste. What about you?"
"Viperion"|"Ladybug"|-0.0647400617599487|"Ladybug! I heard his name! Shall I rewind?"
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.165364146232605|" No— Wait— Not— Not yet. "
"Adrien"|"Viperion"|-0.27729731798172|"I understand. It's never easy to show your true self to someone. You'd wonder what the other person would think of you if they'll like you. It's hard for me, too, you know? My heart's beating so fast, I've waited for this moment for so long! Imagine the stories that I have come up with when you saved my life as Adrien, or when you wanted to give me another Miraculous! It was awful having to hide Cat Noir from you. I'm so glad I don't have to do that anymore! I hope you're not too disappointed. But whoever you are behind that mask, you'll always be the most amazing person in the world."
"Viperion"|"Viperion"|-0.472705185413361|"Ladybug! We're almost out of time! "
"Viperion"|"Luka"|-0.616068929433823|" Oh no, there's no going back now. "
"Luka"|"Ladybug"|0.714501619338989|" I hope she knows what she's doing."
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.590766221284866|"I am... Ma— Ma— Mari— madly awkward! "
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.74265718460083|" Take all the time you need. I'll wait 'til you're ready. Besides, now that you know who I am, you know where to find me!"
"Ladybug"|"Luka"|-0.572140067815781|" Uhh, right! I'll take my think to time— er— uh— see you sooner!"
"Luka"|"Ladybug"|-0.167602777481079|" What made you change your mind?"
"Ladybug"|"Luka"|-0.242892920970917|" I... guess I'm just curious to see what's gonna happen. After that..."
"Luka"|"Ladybug"|-0.519817143678665|" But you said it was too dangerous to know his identity."
"Ladybug"|"Tikki"|0.0787652730941772|" As long as Cat Noir doesn't know who I am, it'll be okay. And I'm gonna make sure of that, starting with Grand Master Su-Han."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.701956033706665|" This is wonderful! Since Cat Noir's in love with Ladybug, that means he's in love with you! You and Adrien can finally be together!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.600415587425232|"It's not that simple, Tikki. I'm in love with Adrien, but I've never been in love with Cat Noir.It's as if they are two completely different people! Is the Adrien I'm in love with the fake Adrien? Is Cat Noir the \"real\" Adrien? Who's the real Adrien behind Adrien?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.273471772670746|" I don't know. Why don't you ask Alya?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.612066507339478|" I can't. She already knows I'm Ladybug. She can never know that Adrien is Cat Noir. It'd be too dangerous. "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.526979088783264|"When she's ready, she will tell me who she is! In the meantime, she'll get to know me!And then, who knows?I'm so char-meow-ing after all!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.0479282736778259|" I usually like smelly cheese, but I get the feeling that this is gonna turn into some really really stinky cheese. "
"Adrien"|"Ms. Bustier"|-0.671499580144882|" Woohoohooo!"
"Ms. Bustier"|"Adrien"|0.59452748298645|" Who can tell me who wrote \"I Am a Cat\"?"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.268951833248138|" Meow meow?"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.0296416282653809|" Or in human language, Natsume Sōseki."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.0877902507781982|" He wrote the book \"I Am a Cat\". Sorry for the joke, Ms. Bustier!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.69270721077919|" Sorry, I'm so madly awkward. Uh— I mean clumsy. I'm madly clumsy—"
"Adrien"|"Rose"|-0.668386578559875|" Don't worry about cat— Uh, I mean, that! It happens to everyone."
"Rose"|"Luka"|-0.0572398900985718|"I only want them to be mine, mine, mine. Dreaming about them in the nights! You know I love unicorns And nothing makes me feel better! "
"Luka"|"Adrien"|-0.585232496261597|" I feel like you're not hearing the same tune anymore when you look at Adrien."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.690507292747498|"I think that song sounded great!"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.115902602672577|" Luka, have you ever thought you knew a person really well only to find out that they have a secret side to them that you couldn't possibly imagine?"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.299741506576538|" Yes."
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.320783197879791|" And, did it... completely change your way of seeing them? Like all of a sudden, everything feels strange 'cause you don't really know them anymore?"
"Luka"|"Adrien"|-0.158754944801331|" Quite the opposite, actually. Once I got over the shock, it helped me to get to know them better, and liked them even more. "
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.68939596414566|" Sorry, I... I think I'm thirsty! "
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|0.315531492233276|" Adrien, the lollipop monster is back. Meet me at the Arc de Triomphe!"
"Adrien"|"Cat Noir"|-0.408214569091797|" Right away! Plagg, claws out! "
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir and Ladybug"|0.331302165985107|" The usual manouvers, m'lady?"
"Cat Noir and Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it."

"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.388264060020447|" Wait! I'm... I'm ready now."
"Ladybug"|"Marinette"|-0.683466970920563|" Spots off."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.104167580604553|"Please, say something! "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.747373849153519|"I guess, now that you know it's me, you don't like me anymore."
"Adrien"|"Ms. Bustier"|0.110069751739502|" No!It's that, I just found out that one of my closest friends is the person I love and admire most in the world."
"Ms. Bustier"|"Marinette"|0.350837230682373|" Come, my fine cat, against my loving heart; sheathe your sharp claws, and settle. And let my eyes into your pupils dart, where agate sparks with metal. "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.725006937980652|"I can't wait to see you."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.135077178478241|" Me too."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.577963948249817|"See you at the movies tomorrow, then!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.671739876270294|"Are you hanging up?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.688552558422089|"No, you hang up!"
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.477636814117432|" Sweet dreams, m'lady. "
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.393487691879272|" Adrien, get up."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.263217926025391|"Yes, Father."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.605737924575806|" Follow me. "
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.263217926025391|" Yes, Father. "
"Gabriel"|"Plagg"|0.538674354553223|" This way. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.111409425735474|" Did you know this was in your house?"
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.659367352724075|" I'm not even sure we're still in my house. Stay hidden, Plagg.Mom?"
"Gabriel"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.328006505966187|" One hundred weeks since she disappeared. One hundred times have I wanted to tell you.Nooroo, Dusuu, dual metamorphosis! "
"Shadow Moth"|"Adrien"|0.0507006645202637|" One hundred times have I tried to seize Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous to bring her back! To think that this illusion was right here right under my roof!Ephemeral, I am your father Shadow Moth. I'm giving you the power to speed up time and help me bring your mother back. All I ask in return are Ladybug's Miraculous... and yours."
"Adrien"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.510345727205276|"No! You can't ask me to do that! No, no!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Adrien"|-0.103661119937897|" Do you understand me, son?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.263217926025391|"Yes, Father. "
"Plagg"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.586401492357254|" Cataclys—!!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Marinette"|0.549085736274719|" Enough, kwami! I am your master now! "
"Marinette"|"Shadownoir"|-0.388314068317413|" Adrien?"
"Shadownoir"|"Marinette"|0.280109167098999|" Hello, Ladybug."
"Marinette"|"Ladybug"|-0.554696828126907|" Tikki, spots on! "
"Ladybug"|"Shadownoir"|0.658301115036011|" Lucky Charm! "
"Shadownoir"|"Ephemeral"|0.212688684463501|"Could this be the hour of your defeat?"
"Ephemeral"|"Shadownoir"|-0.669667035341263|"I'm sorry, I promise this won't take long. "
"Shadownoir"|"Luka"|-0.503097534179688|" Time flies when we're having fun!Running is pointless! In just a few seconds you'll be a simple young girl without powers again!"
"Luka"|"Shadownoir"|-0.310295164585114|" \"Sass is in my sewing box\"?Marinette! "
"Shadownoir"|"Marinette"|0.527366876602173|" Those earrings are MINE!!!"
"Marinette"|"Shadownoir"|-0.665242671966553|" NO! NO! ADRIEN, HELP!"
"Shadownoir"|"Luka"|0.501248836517334|" Ah!Yes! My greatest wish will finally come true!"
"Luka"|"Luka"|-0.695058614015579|" Sorry! Marinette sent me."
"Luka"|"Sass"|-0.00896430015563965|" Sass!"
"Sass"|"Luka"|-0.276955187320709|" Don't worry, he knows."
"Luka"|"Sass"|0.350794076919556|" Sass, Marinette sent me this. I think she wants me to go back to this exact moment. But she knows I can no longer do that."
"Sass"|"Barkk"|-0.519211798906326|" You can't, but I can. I can go back to any temporal marker that has been placed in the past."
"Barkk"|"Wayzz"|-0.736846834421158|" But when a Kwami uses their power without a holder it always has disastrous consequences!"
"Wayzz"|"Kwamis"|-0.0180426836013794|" The situation must really be desperate for the guardian to suggest that!"
"Kwamis"|"Luka"|-0.661768704652786|" Oh no! Not that, not again! It's the end of the world!"
"Luka"|"Sass"|-0.433070659637451|" What's going on?"
"Sass"|"Luka"|0.474732756614685|" Shadow Moth must have taken control of Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous, and he made a wish!"
"Luka"|"Sass"|-0.583217740058899|" But what has that got to do with the end of the world?"
"Sass"|"Barkk"|-0.596167206764221|" Imagine the world as your school notebook. Everything inside is written in blue, but now you want it to be red instead. Before you can rewrite anything in the color you'd like, you have to erase everything that's already been written in blue!"
"Barkk"|"Luka"|-0.366779923439026|" That's what happens when someone makes a wish! The universe is destroyed, and then entirely rebuilt! But who knows how..."
"Luka"|"Sass"|0.238556742668152|" Sass, hurry!"
"Sass"|"Ladybug"|-0.128132224082947|" Second Chance! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.253464937210083|" The countdown has begun. It's 1 am, and we've got just five minutes before you transform back. So we've got to be done by 1:05. You'll rewind on my signal."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.72496286034584|"I'm sorry, but I really couldn't make it—"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.721795320510864|" What on earth is happening?"
"Ladybug"|"Jeanne d'Arc"|-0.433264672756195|" It's like history's all jumbled up!"
"Jeanne d'Arc"|"Cat Noir"|0.59325909614563|" Hark, what are those voices I hear? Bertrand? Gilles? My, what sorcery is this? "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.34853333234787|" Time has gone crazy! Or maybe I have..."
"Ladybug"|"Viperion"|-0.44072824716568|" I have a bad feeling about this. Viperion! Viperion, can you hear me? Follow me!"
"Viperion"|"Ladybug"|-0.150023877620697|" Ladybug, can you hear me?"
"Ladybug"|"Viperion"|0.203671336174011|" Viperion! I've gotta talk to Sass!"
"Viperion"|"Sass"|-0.524211406707764|" Scales rest! "
"Sass"|"Ladybug"|-0.663911104202271|" I'm so sorry, Ladybug, I had no choice!"
"Ladybug"|"Sass"|-0.688606411218643|" What happened?"
"Sass"|"Cat Noir"|0.649021029472351|" I'm not really sure. I just saw a photo of a lucky charm, a watch showing 1 am."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.0668756365776062|" Do you understand any of this?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.078096866607666|" When kwamis use their power without a holder, it always has magical and disastrous consequences. And Sass's power is to turn back time!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.387904822826385|" So time has gotten all mixed up!"
"Ladybug"|"Captain Hardrock"|0.345733404159546|" Stay here, Luka!"
"Captain Hardrock"|"Ladybug"|0.588405251502991|" Liberty! Next stop, city hall!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.554571151733398|" Woah, I'm getting major Déjà vu right now!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.601365566253662|" It's time to have a genius idea, m'lady!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.658301115036011|" Lucky Charm!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.650210618972778|" Do you think this will be enough to tip the balance of time?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0297654867172241|" Oh, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures! This organization coordinates the hours of the whole world with its satellite! It's right near Paris!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.431253850460052|" Which means the satellite is just above our heads! We fix it, we fix all the connected devices that depend on time to function! How are we going to know the exact time to program into the satellite?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.593683838844299|" Thanks to this countdown, I still have a way to know what time it is for real. When it gets to the end, that'll mean that it's exactly 1:05 am. That's what we'll program into the satellite. Time to suit up!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.349800109863281|" Mmm. But, what's the plan with all the apparitions?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0211977958679199|" Leave them to my magical ladybugs."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.297042489051819|" Power up! "
"Ladybug"|"Astro Cat"|0.57741916179657|" Let's sync up our stopwatches."
"Astro Cat"|"Ladybug"|0.65227210521698|" Now I have exactly the same countdown as you."
"Ladybug"|"Cosmobug"|0.297042489051819|" Power up! "
"Cosmobug"|"Astro Cat"|0.32771909236908|" Ready, Astro Cat?"
"Astro Cat"|"Cosmobug"|0.35057806968689|" Ready, Cosmobug!"
"Cosmobug"|"Cosmobug"|-0.277560472488403|" Okay, take off!"
"Cosmobug"|"Cosmobug and Astro Cat"|0.223827004432678|" Miraculous Ladybug!"
"Cosmobug and Astro Cat"|"Astro Cat"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it!"
"Astro Cat"|"Cosmobug"|0.144954204559326|"Meow, meow, meow... Meow-meow! "
"Cosmobug"|"Astro Cat"|0.579623818397522|" That's a pretty tune, what is it?"
"Astro Cat"|"Cosmobug"|0.11369526386261|" A classical piece. Thus spoke Catathustra. By the way, what did you wanna talk about earlier, up on the Eiffel Tower?"
"Cosmobug"|"Astro Cat"|-0.67486172914505|" Oh, nothing important. Forget about it."
"Astro Cat"|"Cosmobug"|0.599032402038574|" Hmm. Atta blast!"
"Cosmobug"|"Su-Han"|-0.683466970920563|" Spots off!"
"Su-Han"|"Ladybug"|0.603878736495972|" So, do you know who Cat Noir is yet?"
"Ladybug"|"Su-Han"|-0.586760878562927|" No."
"Su-Han"|"Ladybug"|-0.51205986738205|" What? I thought I had warned you—"
"Ladybug"|"Su-Han"|-0.597033977508545|" I don't want to know. I've proven to you a hundred times that I'm a good guardian, and Cat Noir and I have proven to you a hundred times that we were exceptional superheroes, and you! How many times have you told us that we were messing up, when that was totally untrue? You're judging us based on your own fears, and not on our actions!"
"Su-Han"|"Ladybug and Su-Han"|-0.61444479227066|"You're right, little Ladybug. Perhaps I'm worrying over nothing. What's for sure is that one doesn't come across a guardian like you every century.How do you say again?"
"Ladybug and Su-Han"|"Gabriel"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it."
"Nadja Chamack"|"Marinette"|-0.157106816768646|" Don't be bemused, it's just the news! The Louvre Museum will be unveiling its latest acquisition today: a mysterious statue carved from hardened lava, which was recently discovered on the highest mountaintops of Tibet, by the museum's curator, Mr. Kubdel."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.388314068317413|"Adrien."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.747711896896362|" Marinette, I asked Alix to get us into this unveiling so I could show you what I figured out about superheroes. Not so you could gawk at Adrien. You can do that any day at school, girl."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.558331489562988|" Super Adrien… —ah, heroes! I'm all ears."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.667473673820496|" Cool, so first you need to know that superheroes like Ladybug and Cat Noir get their powers from magic jewels called Miraculous."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.420193195343018|" You told me you're gonna stop researching Ladybug so you wouldn't jeopardize her secret identity!"
"Alya"|"Alya"|0.398994565010071|" Oh, I—I know. Except this research has nothing to do with her identity. I'm gonna help Ladybug unmask Hawk Moth! And I think I found a connection between superheroes, Hawk Moth, and the Miraculous."
"Alya"|"Alya"|0.0712002515792847|" Okay, I'm convinced Ladybug, Cat Noir, and other Miraculous holders have been depicted through the centuries. Until, for some unknown reason, they disappeared, and the world forgot about them. We already know this. The Ladybug from Ancient Egypt."
"Alya"|"Alix"|0.663187861442566|" Here, a black knight, or Black Cat Miraculous holder."
"Alix"|"Alya"|-0.560151398181915|" Hmm…"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.693386316299438|" Here, a lady, or a Butterfly superhero. Now this, Hercules, or Lion Miraculous holder."
"Marinette"|"Alix"|0.521686673164368|" Okay, so now there's a Lion Miraculous?"
"Alix"|"Alya"|0.437860250473022|" Why not a Bunny Miraculous while you're at it?"
"Alya"|"Alix"|0.0292742252349854|" Now you know back in the day sculptures were painted, right? Most of the paint vanished over time, but tiny microscopic pigments still remain. Thanks to this special app, witness how it originally looked. But here's the big thing. All these works of art have something in common. It's the same symbol! Look, everywhere.It's like some kind of secret society emblem. As if a kind of Order of the Guardians has been watching over the superheroes since the beginning of time!"
"Alix"|"Adrien"|0.18850314617157|" Huh, looks like the symbol on the Tibetan statue my old man found. "
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|-0.0393012762069702|" Nathalie, are you okay?"
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|-0.752497360110283|" It's nothing, Adrien. Just a dizzy spell."
"Adrien"|"Alix"|0.365046739578247|" Maybe we should head home now. "
"Alix"|"Alya"|0.151071429252625|" According to my old man, the statue is almost two hundred years old!"
"Alya"|"Alix"|-0.491110444068909|" From what I found, there hasn't been any Miraculous-wearing superheroes for the last two hundred years!"
"Alix"|"Alya"|0.620846390724182|" So… this statue would be the last known trace of a Miraculous."
"Alya"|"Alix"|-0.174717724323273|" Until Ladybug and Cat Noir showed up a few months ago to fight Hawk Moth, yeah!"
"Alix"|"Alya"|0.625053405761719|" That's rad!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.417930364608765|" I'm sure my video will help Ladybug unmask Hawk Moth!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.187151670455933|" Wait! You're gonna publish your theories on the Ladyblog?"
"Alya"|"Alix"|-0.179514169692993|" Actually… I already uploaded a video."
"Alix"|"Marinette"|0.668075442314148|" The mystery of the Miraculous. It's beyond awesome!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.7370685338974|" For sure it is… right? Amazing! I'm sure Ladybug will be super excited about it. And so will Hawk Moth… I gotta go. I forgot I had, uh… homework! Catch you later!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.60633385181427|" It's like some kind of secret society emblem. As if a kind of Order of the Guardians has been watching over the superheroes since the beginning of time."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.704446405172348|" It's my fault, Master. I'm sorry. I never should have entrusted her with the Miraculous."
"Master Fu"|"Alya"|0.00970172882080078|" Alya is an excellent journalist. Sooner or later, she would have unveiled this secret kept under wraps for centuries. But don't worry. None of it can lead Hawk Moth to us."
"Alya"|"Master Fu"|0.573091268539429|" This statue that arrived at the Louvre earlier this week."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.689945489168167|" Impossible! That's impossible! We are doomed!"
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.680298030376434|" Because of a statue? But just a second ago you were saying—"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.665056318044662|" That's not a statue, Marinette. It's a Peacock!"
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.513822257518768|" But, Master, Cat Noir and I have already defeated sentimonsters created by Mayura."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.478657722473145|" Yes, but… None of them came close to the power of this one. It was born from a negative emotion of a young man who had no idea what he was creating. Remember when I told you I made a terrible mistake? For you to understand, I must tell you the entire story.I was younger than you when I was chosen to be a guardian. My parents told me that it was a great honor. That I couldn't turn it down. So they took me to the temple. I wasn't very happy there. I would have preferred to live with my parents and be with other children my age. I didn't want to be a guardian of anything. One of the test to become a guardian required me to watch over a grimoire he managed to save, and the Miraculous Box. The very last Miraculous Box. That's when I realized my sentimonster had devoured all the other Miraculous Boxes that were kept in the temple. And when the monks tried to stop it—the temple, the Order of the Guardians, everything… it was destroyed. I tried to run away from the sentimonster. But by doing so, I lost the grimoire and both the Butterfly and the Peacock Miraculous. I thought the sentimonster had disappeared forever.As soon as Hawk Moth finds out about it, he'll be able to use the power of the Peacock to bring it back to life."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.601155757904053|" Master, if that happens, Cat Noir and I will be there."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.641060799360275|" But you won't stand a chance! He's totally immune to the powers of the Miraculous! And please stop calling me Master. I have never been a guardian to begin with. I will not make another mistake! You and Cat Noir will give me your Miraculous back and I'll leave Paris with the Miracle Box, since that's what the monster is after. They will come after me, sparing the city and its inhabitants."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.360803544521332|" But what if it catches up with you this time?"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.608575254678726|" That will be my fate. It's all my fault, after all."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.476329028606415|" I won't let you leave on your own! When you chose me to become Ladybug, you placed your trust in me. I'm asking you to do the same today."
"Master Fu"|"Gabriel Agreste"|0.667727708816528|" Thank you, Marinette. Thank you for everything."
"Gabriel Agreste"|"Nathalie"|-0.698625594377518|" Nathalie sometimes gets dizzy spells. But it's nothing serious."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.20507276058197|" It's thoughtful of you to be concerned, Adrien."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.577634066343307|" You don't have to worry about her."
"Adrien"|"Alya"|0.00404155254364014|" If you say so, Father. "
"Alya"|"Nathalie"|0.56821882724762|" And that same symbol is on this statue that arrived at the Louvre earlier this week."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.65567547082901|" I felt an amok within. This isn't a statue, it's a dormant sentimonster. Very old and very powerful."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.359245538711548|" Which means you can destroy it, or bring it back to life."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.644904285669327|" But since I wasn't the one who created it, I won't be able to control it."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.677942395210266|" I will help you. It comes from the region where we found our Miraculous. I have a strong feeling it could prove very useful to my quest. You will return to the Louvre tonight."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.73852002620697|" Very well. "
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.169517695903778|" You should get some rest before you go."
"Nathalie"|"Plagg"|-0.571463584899902|" Don't worry, I'll be fine."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.595682382583618|" Why the long face?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.53102707862854|" My mom used to have dizzy spells… just like Nathalie. My father said those weren't serious either."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.61685037612915|" How about a duet?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.0173497796058655|" You play the piano?"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.459515333175659|" My talents go way beyond sniffing out cheese, young man. "
"Adrien"|"Mayura"|0.134030222892761|" Mom's the only one who could make me laugh like that. Thank you, Plagg."
"Mayura"|"Dormant Sentimonster"|0.139235019683838|" I can feel its yearning, Hawk Moth. It's hungry; ravenous for Miraculous."
"Dormant Sentimonster"|"Mayura"|0.642358303070068|" Yum, yum! Miraculous!"
"Mayura"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.651956856250763|" You take one more step and I'll take your amok away from you. Do you really want me to destroy you? The sentimonster's all yours, Hawk Moth."
"Hawk Moth"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.576341062784195|" The frustration of a Miraculous just out of your grasp! I know that feeling of hunger only too well.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize this sentimonster!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Feast"|0.381067395210266|"Feast, I am Hawk Moth. You have a consuming hunger that only the Miraculous can satisfy. I'm giving you the power to track them down and devour every single one! But after you've swallowed up their owners, you must bring two Miraculous back to me. The one of the Ladybug and the Black Cat. Oh, but don't you worry, I'll give them back to you as soon as I'm done with them. I'll even give you the Peacock and mine as a bonus. Annd thus you shall have eaten every single Miraculous, and your hunger shall be satiated. Do we have an agreement?Right, it's dinner time, Feast. "
"Feast"|"Plagg"|0.684797048568726|" Yummy! Miraculous!"
"Plagg"|"Wayzz"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?"

"Marinette"|"Wayzz"|-0.607405841350555|" No! Master! Wait!"
"Wayzz"|"Master Fu"|0.634306073188782|" Master, is this the best solution?"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.252352297306061|" It's the only solution."
"Marinette"|"Feast"|0.537388920783997|" Master!"
"Feast"|"Master Fu"|0.698215484619141|" Yummy, yummy! Miraculous!"
"Master Fu"|"Wayzz"|-0.154049694538116|" See, Wayzz? If Marinette had kept her Miraculous, the sentimonster would have swallowed her right up."
"Wayzz"|"Master Fu"|-0.0553009510040283|" Or she would have transformed into Ladybug and fought it."
"Master Fu"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.684037804603577|" Sometimes fighting is futile, Wayzz."
"Hawk Moth"|"Mayura"|0.676225423812866|" Feast is attracted by the Miraculous's scent. The man it's chasing can only be the guardian of the Miraculous."
"Mayura"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.582314640283585|" Soon he'll have nothing left to guard.Feast is going to devour everything."
"Hawk Moth"|"Cat Noir "|0.631133317947388|" And we shall relish the taste of triumph, my dear Mayura."

"Ladybug "|"Cat Noir "|-0.154220581054688|" Cat Noir? Is that you?"
"Cat Noir "|"Ladybug "|-0.0230276584625244|" Of course it is. Who else would you expect by your side?"
"Ladybug "|"Cat Noir "|-0.330382108688354|" Isn't that costume of yours a little unsafe?"
"Cat Noir "|"Ladybug "|-0.482235550880432|" Only on the outside. I've got a helmet and pads on under my banana peel, Bugaboo."
"Ladybug "|"Cat Noir "|0.0125668048858643|" If you call me Bugaboo one more time I'll start calling you Bananoir."
"Cat Noir "|"Ladybug "|0.725619316101074|" As you wish, Bugaboo."
"Ladybug "|"Bus Driver"|0.569171071052551|" Let's take a shortcut. There! The bus! Hey, driver! I'm Ladybug and I need you to help me!"
"Bus Driver"|"Cat Noir "|0.467270374298096|" Ladybug. Right. And your buddy here is the famous Banana Cat, I presume."
"Cat Noir "|"Ladybug "|-0.0542804598808289|" Just call me Bananoir."
"Ladybug "|"Bus Driver"|-0.503367066383362|" It doesn't matter who we are. That man is being chased by a monster and we have to help him!"
"Bus Driver"|"Ladybug "|0.717461943626404|" Okay, you can count on me!"
"Ladybug "|"Wayzz"|0.598575472831726|" Thank you, Super Driver. Now!"
"Wayzz"|"Wang Fu"|-0.335714221000671|" Master, look! Ladybug and Cat Noir, despite their ridiculous costumes, they haven't let you down!"
"Wang Fu"|"Roger Raincomprix"|-0.314097166061401|" That's impossible! They don't have their Miraculous!"
"Roger Raincomprix"|"Roger Raincomprix"|-0.517710268497467|" Okay, I'll help you, but ride on the side of the road before you get hurt."

"André Glacier"|"Wayzz"|0.593111157417297|" My name is André, I make the ice cream, my friends with masks—"
"Wayzz"|"Cat Noir "|-0.131843864917755|" Master, it's obvious it's them—who else would do something so crazy?"
"Cat Noir "|"Ladybug "|0.256139755249023|" Hey, have a taste of this! Some exploding banana split from Bananoir!"
"Ladybug "|"Wayzz"|0.718020915985107|" Much tastier than any Miraculous!"
"Wayzz"|"Master Fu"|-0.641595333814621|" Look, Master, there's no use in running! Your disciples never give up the fight, no matter what! With or without their Miraculous, they are Ladybug and Cat Noir!"
"Master Fu"|"Wayzz"|-0.718778938055038|" I don't want to be the cause of their disappearance!"
"Wayzz"|"Master Fu"|-0.11649888753891|" Whether you like it or not, you're the guardian!"
"Master Fu"|"Cat Noir "|0.663799405097961|" Precisely. This is my decision to make!"
"Cat Noir "|"Ladybug "|-0.741339176893234|" André, we're out of ammo!"
"Ladybug "|"Master Fu"|-0.0756573677062988|" André, go somewhere safe! We're gonna handle this!…I hope…"
"Master Fu"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.173047721385956|" Hey! Leave them alone! I'm the one you have been wanting the past one hundred and seventy-two years!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Master Fu"|0.545093894004822|" The guardian of the Miraculous is this decrepit old man?"
"Master Fu"|"Feast"|0.404005289077759|" Looking for this?"
"Feast"|"Hawk Moth"|0.642358303070068|" Yum, yum! Miraculous!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Master Fu"|-0.646657794713974|" You won't have any trouble getting rid of him, Feast!"
"Master Fu"|"Wayzz"|0.35647189617157|" Go and transform, quickly!I am the last of the Miraculous guardians, and I intend to accomplish my mission! I am not scared of you anymore!Thank you, Ladybug."
"Wayzz"|"Master Fu"|0.699759364128113|" I knew you'd make the right choice!"
"Master Fu"|"Wayzz"|-0.116010189056396|" Come on, Wayzz, shell o—ack!"
"Wayzz"|"Ladybug"|-0.19837898015976|" Master, your back! You know you're too old to play superheroes!"
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.224455296993256|" We can handle this. Take the Miraculous Box and go hide."
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|0.266014695167542|" Enjoy, Feast. They can't get away from you now!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.645985871553421|" We have to find its amok!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.651597023010254|" Except this sentimonster isn't carrying any baggage!"
"Ladybug"|"Master Fu"|-0.440464317798615|" Cover me! Lucky Charm!A metal detector? When you created the sentimonster, you put the amok inside your staff, right?"
"Master Fu"|"Ladybug"|0.629398822784424|" Correct."
"Ladybug"|"Master Fu"|-0.390019476413727|" Was your staff made out of metal, by any chance?"
"Master Fu"|"Ladybug"|-0.184154510498047|" Partially, yes."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.321817636489868|" There are only two places where your staff could be. Where the temple was, or…"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.0989229083061218|" Hey! Hurry, my lady, this thing already swallowed my stick whole! Aah!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.577983617782593|" Go hide, Master! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.63877546787262|" Uh, you sure it's the right time, my lady?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.138868451118469|" Ready to get the staff back?"
"Cat Noir"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.61680194735527|" Oh no, not the tongue… "
"Hawk Moth"|"Feast"|0.693646907806396|" Yes! Great work, Feast! Keep those two Miraculous nice and warm for me, and enjoy the other ones—you've certainly earned them."
"Feast"|"Cat Noir"|0.650503516197205|" Mm? Yum yum! Miraculous!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.106876015663147|" Wow… It's bigger on the inside. —Oh! My stick!What is that? Is it digesting things or something?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.370050489902496|" Whatever he swallows gets sealed here forever."
"Cat Noir"|"Master Fu"|-0.273532330989838|" In that case, we'd better hurry up and figure out where the Master's staff is hiding."
"Master Fu"|"Wayzz"|-0.00132137537002563|" Farewell, my dear Wayzz. You're the best kwami I could have ever hoped to have by my side all these years."
"Wayzz"|"Ladybug"|0.654521107673645|" It's been an honor to be your kwami, Master."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.634984642267227|" I knew it! It had to be intact, otherwise the sentimonster would have disappeared!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.301955223083496|" Be careful what you wish for! Cataclysm!"
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.606005072593689|" No more evil-doing for you. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha! Bye-bye, little butterfly."
"Hawk Moth"|"Nathalie"|-0.637702405452728|" No! That's impossible!"
"Nathalie"|"Ladybug"|-0.0264630317687988|" I'm fine."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug, Cat Noir, & Master Fu"|0.223827004432678|" Miraculous Ladybug! "
"Ladybug, Cat Noir, & Master Fu"|"Master Fu"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it!"
"Master Fu"|"Ladybug"|-0.23366504907608|" Thank you, Ladybug. Because of you, I won't have to run anymore."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.371038854122162|" I only put your teaching to practice, Master. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.134754240512848|" I know two people who'd better run before they transform back."
"Ladybug"|"Nadja Chamack"|-0.378377139568329|" Goodbye, Master."
"Nadja Chamack"|"Nadja Chamack"|0.156783580780029|" Don't be bemused, it's just the news! Extraordinary and inexplicable!"
"Nadja Chamack"|"Nadja Chamack"|0.479972362518311|" That pretty much sums up the surprising reappearance of this temple in the Tibetan mountains—"
"Nadja Chamack"|"Nadja Chamack"|-0.317556619644165|" —a hundred and seventy-two years after it was destroyed."
"Nadja Chamack"|"Clara Contard"|0.348366856575012|" Let's go to Clara Contard on location."
"Clara Contard"|"Alya"|0.2387615442276|" That's correct, Nadja. But what makes this phenomenon particularly unexplainable is that all the monks who used to—"
"Alya"|"Clara Contard"|0.661396384239197|" Whoa! The symbol of the guardians of the Miraculous!"
"Clara Contard"|"Alya"|0.313897013664246|" —live in the temple have also reappeared—"
"Alya"|"Clara Contard"|0.389743685722351|" I gotta add this to the Ladyblog!"
"Clara Contard"|"Master Fu"|-0.714482128620148|" — they disappeared in the year 1844!"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.0348622798919678|" So my mistake has been undone. The monks have been freed and the temple has been restored. I can't thank you enough, Marinette. And Cat Noir. I'm finally free from the burden of the past that has been haunting me for so long. I shall go and see them someday soon, and explain everything to them.Your training is complete, Marinette. You are now a fully-fledged Ladybug. And the time has come for me to prepare you to become the new guardian."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.398757100105286|" The guardian? But Master, you're the guardian! You have been for a hundred and seventy-two years!"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.652995705604553|" Precisely. It's high time I handed it over. You have proven that you are more worthy of it than I am. In fact, your training is starting right now. You will spend the next twenty-four hours meditating with the Miracle Box without anything to eat."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.161969661712646|" Uh, actually I… I need to help at the bakery."
"Master Fu"|"Wang Fu"|-0.551120400428772|"I was joking. Those strict traditions did no good when I was your age. I have no intention of continuing them. Instead, your first task will be to help me carry these boxes to my van."
"Wang Fu"|"Gabriel"|0.50364089012146|" Now that Hawk Moth knows who I am——it's too dangerous for me to live here. But don't worry, Marinette. Whenever you and Cat Noir need me, I will always be here for you.I'm not going anywhere until Hawk Moth is defeated. I'll never leave you. "
"Gabriel"|"Nadja Chamack"|-0.276664435863495|" I have not digested my defeat, Ladybug. It's simply honed my appetite all the more. But now that I know what the guardian looks like, I intend to put that knowledge to use, and prepare a dish of revenge especially for you! And it shall be served very cold."
"Gabriel Agreste"|"Nathalie"|0.648086905479431|"Ladybug and Cat Noir's miraculous will soon be mine, I promise. Then, I will get the ultimate power, and we shall all be together again.You and I.Soon, Emilie."
"Nathalie"|"Nathalie"|0.295439958572388|"Of course. Someone will get you right away. "
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|-0.435207724571228|" It's been one year. The longer you keep him in the dark about what you're doing, the harder it'll be on him when he finds out. "
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.475009143352509|"Little kitty on a roof, all alone without his -"
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.388314068317413|" Adrien."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.00576126575469971|" Father?"
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.386198401451111|"There is something important I have to talk to you about. I think about telling you every day, but I don't know how to find the right words."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.381146430969238|" I think I already know, father."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.385629296302795|" But, how?"
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.647509574890137|" I've noticed how close you and Nathalie have become. If she can make you happy again, then... as far as I'm concerned, she's already part of our family."
"Gabriel"|"Plagg"|-0.487870454788208|"How could you possibly think such a thing?! Nobody could ever replace your mother,as long as she is still in our hearts she lives on!We're expecting guests. Be ready. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.614816278219223|"Wow! Your father's like a piece of tomme cheese: where the rind's so thick it's almost impossible to get inside the center."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.705382764339447|" Don't be so hard on him, Plagg. It's been a year today since Mom... went away forever."
"Marinette"|"Alix"|-0.508837193250656|" We can't leave Adrien all alone on a day like this."
"Alix"|"Marinette"|-0.557038128376007|"True that, but there's no way his old man's gonna let us see him."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.536913394927979|" Okay, why don't we make them a video and tell him how much we all care about him?"
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.590114712715149|" Great idea, we can take turns recording our messages."
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.524692893028259|" Then send it to him. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.412662386894226|"Okay, go Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.684566736221313|"Ah - ! Yee- ! No, no, someone else go -I still need to go figure out what I'm going to say."
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.386178612709045|"Okay, girl. So Nino, ready?Action! "
"Nino"|"Nathalie"|0.384232640266418|" Hey, my dude!"

"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.360031485557556|"Ah... I'll be right there. "
"Adrien"|"Amelie"|-0.416328847408295|"Mom...?"
"Amelie"|"Gabriel"|0.623569965362549|"My, my! Look at how much you've grown.Gabriel, isn't he just the absolute cutest?"
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.708608150482178|"I'm sure Adrien is delighted to have such a timely visit from his aunt, today of all days."
"Adrien"|"Amelie"|-0.0573879480361938|"Aunt Amelie?"
"Amelie"|"Adrien"|0.591432332992554|" I'm soo happy to see you again! I thought it'd be better if we were all together on a day like this! Don't you agree, dear?"
"Adrien"|"Amelie"|0.613784313201904|" Félix?Good to see you again!"
"Amelie"|"Gabriel"|0.17869234085083|" Aw, they look just like twins! Don't they, Gabriel? Do you remember when they used to have so much fun pretending to be each other? Once they had you and Emilie fooled for a whole weekend!We laughed so hard! "
"Gabriel"|"Félix"|-0.432442545890808|"I won't be fooled a second time."
"Félix"|"Amelie"|0.526804447174072|" Hello, uncle. "
"Amelie"|"Gabriel"|-0.651358217000961|" Félix, you know your uncle's never been the physical sort.Oh! How sweet! You're still wearing your wedding band! You must have Emilie's too, I imagine? You never replied to my message about that. I'd still like to get the rings back, you know."
"Gabriel"|"Amelie"|0.602475762367249|" These rings are obviously very special to me."
"Amelie"|"Gabriel"|0.385037899017334|" And they're very dear to me too, Gabriel. Those jewels have always been in the Graham de Vanily family, not the Agreste's."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.277750015258789|" We'll discuss it later. It's been a long journey from London, you may want to rest a bit. Nathalie?"
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.63460385799408|"Follow me, please. "
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.168298840522766|"Take Félix to your bedroom."
"Adrien"|"Alya"|-0.212881982326508|" Yes, father. C'mon, Félix! "
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.588081836700439|" Just wanted to let you know we're thinking about ya! Mwah! "
"Nino"|"Marinette"|0.646164774894714|" And, cut!You're the last one! Ready?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.16534036397934|"I'd rather record myself!I- I'll be right back!What am I gonna say to him? Help me, Tikki! What would you tell a kwami friend who's lost their mom?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.698338031768799|" The thing is, we kwamis live forever, Marinette. Just let your heart do the talking, and as long as it is filled with love, you can't go wrong!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.315341114997864|" You think?Adrien... I love you. I'll always be there if you need me.Ah! What was I thinking!? Oh, this is the worst day I could possibly choose to tell him! We gotta start over! "
"Tikki"|"Alya"|0.341839075088501|"There'll never be a right day to tell him!"
"Alya"|"Tikki"|0.292119979858398|"Marinette, you done in there? We're all waiting for you!"
"Tikki"|"Alya"|0.0112452507019043|" What if your message to Adrien could turn this worst day ever, into the best day ever?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.596912086009979|" What's goin' on, girl? You feeling sick or somethin'?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.591836929321289|"Promise me you'll send the video without looking at it! No one can see my part!"

"Adrien"|"Félix"|-0.77138377726078|"Do you remember our shooting contests?I'm really sorry I didn't come to your dad's funeral. My father thought it would be too hard on me, considering... everything that's happened this year. You've every right to be mad at me."

"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.231934428215027|" He's very...protective of me. "
"Plagg"|"Félix"|-0.515446186065674|"Huh? "
"Félix"|"Adrien"|0.484287738800049|"Oh! Do you have that chess board we used to play all the time?"
"Adrien"|"Félix"|0.672350645065308|" Of course! Let me go upstairs and get it for us! "

"Adrien"|"Félix"|0.239895105361938|"Found it!"
"Félix"|"Adrien"|0.699107885360718|"Grab a deck of cards, too, while you're up there! "
"Adrien"|"Félix"|0.174083828926086|"You still doing magic?"
"Félix"|"Adrien"|0.280681371688843|"Now more than ever, you'll see! "
"Adrien"|"Félix"|0.454531311988831|"How about karate? Are you still practicing?"

"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.531827300786972|"No, go ahead! Make yourself at home! "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.503194898366928|"What's up with that cousin of yours? First, he searches through your things, and then, the most unforgivable thing of all, he squashes my hunk of goat's cheese under your pillow! I'd been maturing that baby for two weeks! Do you realize? Two whole weeks!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.531418025493622|" Listen, Plagg. Félix lost his dad not so long ago, he's probably not himself."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.697807282209396|"I'm sorry, but there's just no excuse! You never touch my cheese, and yet, you just lost your mother not so long ago, right?Please forgive me, Adrien, I didn't mean to."
"Adrien"|"Félix"|-0.667284488677979|"I know. And I'm sorry about your cheese. "
"Félix"|"Nino"|-0.239891171455383|"Tch! Of course that idiot has a crush on a superhero. "
"Nino"|"Félix"|0.11759078502655|"Hey, my dude! I'm not quite sure what to tell you, except that, you're my man, dude! And bros are always there for their guys!"

"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.445088624954224|" We'll be united, more powerful and free, we'll defeat Hawk Moth, then we can both run away to an island!Far away from everything. We will live off nothing but fruits, and we will have a little pet hamster and we will name it-"

"Kagami"|"Plagg"|-0.77569243311882|" Adrien, the biggest mistake a fencer can make isn't choosing the wrong technique. It's choosing the wrong target. Change targets."

"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.544364422559738|" No. No way. Ladybug's the only one I love. But..."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.680964410305023|" Ladybug doesn't love you, so maybe it's about time you changed your tune. Right?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.515202522277832|" Why should it be different with Kagami? I must not have the right technique, that's all."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.708867192268372|" I don't know a thing about human girls, but whenever I meet a beautiful Camembert, I introduce myself. Hello, Camembert. I'm Plagg. So very nice to eat you."

"Marinette"|"Juleka"|-0.0333312749862671|" I always jumble my words around him. So how could I even manage going out on a date? I think we're actually just meant to be friends. Whenever I talk to him as a friend, I hardly stammer at all. That's a sign right there. Right?"
"Juleka"|"Mylène"|-0.649928092956543|" Um..."
"Mylène"|"Alya"|-0.555621862411499|" Totally not!"
"Alya"|"Luka"|-0.0107088685035706|" You have liked this man for, like, a million years and you're not gonna give up on him right now."
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.294764399528503|"Do you feel kinda like this?Personally, I think a girl like you deserves to feel more like this.And whoever made you feel this way is nothing but a... "
"Marinette"|"Gabriel"|0.722371101379395|"Thanks, Luka.Say, are you free tomorrow?"
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.70600813627243|" Adrien? Aren't you supposed to be working on your fencing moves? Mr. D'Argencourt said he was very disappointed at your last session."
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.677311301231384|" Yes, Father. I'm heading out for a one-on-one lesson with my strongest partner: Kagami."
"Adrien"|"Philippe"|-0.138277769088745|"If you don't mind, could you drive me to the ice rink? I told him I was going for a one-on-one lesson but I didn't say it was a fencing lesson."
"Philippe"|"Andrè"|-0.60304793715477|" I can't believe it, Mr. Mayor! You want to shut my ice rink down!?"
"Andrè"|"Philippe"|-0.503368586301804|" This is not your ice rink, Philippe! It belongs to the Parisians. I'm not closing it down. I'll just be converting it into an indoor gym for my Chloé... er, my city! Nobody comes to your ice rink for lessons anyway. You haven't had a single student sign up this year. Just look around you."
"Philippe"|"André"|-0.313621342182159|"Wrong, Mr. Mayor! Some new skaters!I knew it!"
"André"|"Philippe"|0.555028319358826|" Okay, okay.If you can get just one single sign up within 10 minutes, I'll put the gym conversion work on hold."
"Philippe"|"Adrien"|0.565408229827881|"Consider it done!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.661118507385254|"It was really cool of you to bring Luka, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.722878456115723|" Of course. That's what friends are for. "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.289530515670776|" I don't know what to do about Kagami. Should I offer to hold her hand?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.667252242565155|" You have to let her fall."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.604479342699051|" No, what I actually meant was that you cannot let her fall in any way. I mean, do whatever you can so that she doesn't fall.So yeah, grab ahold of her hand and take her onto the ice and then... AAAAH! "
"Luka"|"Adrien"|0.690691113471985|" Try to be natural. Go with the flow and listen to the rhythm. Just follow my lead. "
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.641056030988693|" Don't be scared. I won't tell anyone."
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.610340595245361|" About what?"
"Kagami"|"Luka"|-0.7579016238451|" That you don't know how to tie your laces.C'mon. "
"Luka"|"Philippe"|-0.361561715602875|" You okay? "
"Philippe"|"Luka"|0.615481734275818|"Hey, young man! Have you ever thought about signing up for ice skating lessons? The judges wouldn't be able to resist that sparkling smile of yours."
"Luka"|"Philippe"|0.52155876159668|" That'snice of you, sir, but my life is already filled with music. And I might have a brand new song to write, so..."
"Philippe"|"Kagami"|0.205989718437195|" Music's an important part of skating, you know. Think about it!"
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.481865167617798|"Did you invite because you were scared of being alone with me?"
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.703349620103836|" Of course not. It's just that I asked Marinette to help me."
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|0.167962074279785|" Help you with what?"
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|0.55749249458313|" Uh... to perfect my figure skating skills."
"Kagami"|"Philippe"|-0.390408635139465|" But you don't need her for that. "
"Philippe"|"Kagami"|0.608723044395447|"You have what it takes to be a champion. The style. The talent. Let me be your private coach."
"Kagami"|"Philippe"|0.390871524810791|" I only practice noble arts like archery or fencing.Ice skating's just for fun."
"Philippe"|"Marinette"|0.710713267326355|"I'll give you a week's worth of lessons for free. Just a few hours a day and you'll be a star."
"Marinette"|"Philippe"|-0.471097350120544|"Thanks, but I'm already very busy as it is."
"Philippe"|"Adrien"|0.688604831695557|"Is that Adrien Agreste!?Adrien Agreste, I can see it now. Grace and style model, and professional ice skating champion. If you take lessons with me, I'll have you shining like the candles on a birthday cake."
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.258103787899017|" Uh... maybe."
"Kagami"|"Adrien and Luka"|0.258250117301941|" He already does fencing with me. "
"Adrien and Luka"|"Philippe"|-0.244829058647156|" Are you okay? "
"Philippe"|"André"|0.673306584358215|" See how a few lessons from me could come in handy? Please, Adrien Agreste. Just put your name on this form and your fans will come running. And my ice rink will be saved!"
"André"|"Philippe"|-0.713197857141495|"None of these young people want to sign up, Philippe. You can't force them now, can you?"
"Philippe"|"Kagami"|0.344954013824463|"You're right. "
"Kagami"|"Luka"|-0.584402531385422|"Get up!The only reason you can't stay on your feet is your hesitation. I never hesitate.Shall we go?"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.140087246894836|" Marinette? Are you okay?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.690197318792343|" I think I hurt myself. It's probably best we call it a day. "
"Adrien"|"André"|-0.67825523018837|"Marinette doesn't look too good. Sorry, Kagami, I have to go and check on her. "
"André"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.682845592498779|" I'm sorry, Philippe, but the ice rink will be closed down tonight. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Tikki"|0.557899475097656|" Ahhh.... a burning passion that's about to be put on ice. What perfect bait for my akuma.Fly away, my pretty akuma, and evilize this ice skater's newly frozen heart."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.779424503445625|" Why are you so sad?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.593577980995178|"I like Luka. He's really nice, but do you think he's just like Adrien? Just a friend?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.140087246894836|"Marinette? Are you okay?"
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|0.286973118782043|" Yeah, I'm fine!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.354661822319031|" You're supposed to be in love with Ladybug, and now you ditch Kagami to go after Marinette?"
"Adrien"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.338447272777557|" Me? Going after Marinette? No! She's just a friend."
"Hawk Moth"|"Philippe"|0.181995511054993|"Frozer. I am Hawk Moth. They want to take your rink away from you. So from now on, all of Paris will be your ice kingdom. In return, you must bring me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous."
"Philippe"|"Adrien"|0.312201380729675|" Ready to skate, Hawk Moth! "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.383707880973816|"What is that?Marinette! Hide!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.261139154434204|"Is that ice?Woah, let's try out Master Fu's magic-aroon."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.274675607681274|" Tikki, power up!Tikki: Stalac Tikki!Marinette: Stalac Tikki, spots on! Ha! "

"Frozer"|"Ladyice"|0.375247001647949|"Ladybug and Cat Noir. Your frozen statues will sparkle like trophies upon my kingdom of ice! "
"Ladyice"|"Icecat"|-0.154230892658234|" Cat Noir. We need to set up a trap for whoever turned the city into a giant ice rink. "
"Icecat"|"Ladyice"|0.420803546905518|"My feline instincts prefer to track and observe before I attack. You go your way, I'll go mine."
"Ladyice"|"Icecat"|-0.65859854221344|" Please don't tell me you're mad at me about the rose."
"Icecat"|"Ladyice"|0.512798666954041|" There may be a certain chill now between us. "
"Ladyice"|"Icecat"|-0.715148776769638|" I get it, but we should really focus on saving Paris right now."
"Icecat"|"Ladyice"|-0.479998767375946|" We don't always have to do everything together, after all. It's not like we're a couple. "
"Ladyice"|"Icecat"|-0.364709913730621|" Cat Noir, don't get all pouty on me! "
"Icecat"|"Ladyice"|0.538674354553223|"This way."
"Ladyice"|"Ladyice"|-0.323679804801941|" I need to set a trap, but what could I use as bait? "
"Ladyice"|"Frozer"|0.581504464149475|" Thanks, Kitty."
"Frozer"|"Ladyice"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Ladyice"|"Icecat"|-0.737470328807831|"He's too fast! I'm positive the akuma's in his skates! "
"Icecat"|"Ladyice"|-0.623507499694824|" My Cataclysm could destroy his skates but he'd have to be up in the air. You were right, M'lady. We're gonna have to set a trap. "
"Ladyice"|"Icecat"|0.48041570186615|" You were right too. We observed and now we know enough."
"Icecat"|"Ladyice"|-0.233726501464844|" Seems we're just missing a little push of luck to get the edge on him."
"Ladyice"|"Ladyice"|0.564577579498291|"Lucky Charm!A bag of salt?Salt makes ice melt!Okay. While I keep Frozer busy, you're gonna have to do some melting. Listen! "

"Ladyice & Cat Noir"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Adrien"|-0.0953488945960999|" You smashed through my plans like an icebreaker, Ladybug. But revenge is a dish best served cold. "

"Philippe"|"Adrien"|0.436612725257874|" Thank you, Adrien."
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|0.67050302028656|" I hope this helps you get more students to sign up. "
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.12795490026474|" You still keep doing what other people want you to do. "
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.562026768922806|" No, I just want him to be happy. And I'm not changing my target. Even if it means failing over and over again, because one day, I will succeed and hit it."

"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.2871994972229|"Marinette? Was there something you wanted to tell me?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.56239914894104|" I love you, Adrien! Even if you love Kagami. I just had to tell you. There!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.659592390060425|" Kagami? I don't love her. You're the one I love. How could I have been so blind?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.722662448883057|" Uh... You love me? So... We can get married and have a beautiful house and a dog, a cat or a hamster, and we'll name it"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.3574059009552|" You OK, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.730508685112|" I just wanted to say that... we should go and skate at the ice rink more often. Yeah!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.355435848236084|" You mean...just you and me?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.325857400894165|" -You and me? Oh, no! course not! Cause we should take the whole gang there. Luka, Kagami, Alya, Nino!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.73980438709259|" You're right. That would be awesome! I'll try to free up some time to do that. See you at school."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.311840236186981|" Tikki, please don't tell me I did it again!"
"Tikki"|"Philippe"|0.0791347026824951|" Don't worry. You'll get there one day, Marinette."

"Marinette"|"Kwamis"|-0.494948327541351|" Uh... You know why you can't come. When he made me the new Guardian, his memory was magically erased. Now, Master Fu is just like everyone else. He can't know about the Miraculous, my secret identity or you Kwamis!Come on, Tikki! Let's go."
"Kwamis"|"Ziggy"|-0.676840633153915|" That's not fair!"
"Ziggy"|"Tikki"|-0.452025771141052|" Why does Tikki get to go and not us?"
"Tikki"|"Trixx"|-0.666921705007553|" I'm sorry, friends, but you know I can't leave Marinette in case she needs to transform."
"Trixx"|"Daizzi"|-0.666486322879791|" But what if we hide too? Then he'd never see us! That'd be okay, right?"
"Daizzi"|"Xuppu"|0.122495055198669|" We just wanna make sure he's okay!"
"Xuppu"|"Marinette"|0.728077411651611|" He took care of us for more than one hundred years, you know!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.348672151565552|" I know! But you're gonna have to let him live his new life with his soulmate! It's my turn to take care of you."
"Marinette"|"Mullo"|0.338455319404602|" I understand, but...Alright, you can come, Wayzz."
"Mullo"|"Trixx"|-0.446384072303772|" Why?"
"Trixx"|"Ziggy"|-0.65345373749733|" Not fair!"
"Ziggy"|"Roaar"|0.622701525688171|" I wanna see him!"
"Roaar"|"Marinette"|0.572453379631042|" I wanna go!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.703458368778229|" I just can’t take all of you at once!"
"Marinette"|"Trixx"|-0.438992500305176|" Because... because the Miracle Box has to be guarded; protected - that's why!"
"Trixx"|"Marinette"|0.37302839756012|" So you're saying is if one of us stays here to keep watch... the rest of us can come, right?"
"Marinette"|"Xuppu"|-0.5740125477314|" Huh? What?! Of course not!"
"Xuppu"|"Sass"|-0.260394275188446|" But how do we choose who stays?"
"Sass"|"Xuppu and Daizzi"|0.11452841758728|" Let's let fate decide."
"Xuppu and Daizzi"|"Marinette"|0.437743306159973|" Yeah; let's do Kwami-Kwa-Who!"
"Marinette"|"Mullo"|-0.641692847013474|" Kwa-What?"
"Mullo"|"Marinette"|0.60966157913208|"Kwami-kweeny-koomy-who, the special chosen one isYOU! There—Marinette stays!"
"Marinette"|"Mullo"|-0.389108896255493|" Oh, no you don't! That's cheating! Besides, I'm the Guardian; I get to decide."
"Mullo"|"Xuppu"|-0.591767460107803|" Hmm, she leaves us no choice..."
"Xuppu"|"Marinette"|0.112553715705872|" Operation Kwami Baby-Doll Eyes!"

"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.723736763000488|" It's my phone. It started on its own again.If it doesn't stop right now, I swear it's gonna end up in the trash!"
"Marinette"|"Marianne"|0.384316086769104|" Hi, Marianne. "
"Marianne"|"Marinette"|0.401910305023193|" Hello, Marinette.Do you remember her, my love? She's the young girl who found you after your paddleboat accident. The one that caused your amnesia. "
"Marinette"|"Wang Fu"|0.537490844726562|" I'm so glad to see you again, Master... I mean, Mr. Fu."
"Wang Fu"|"Wang Fu"|0.702445030212402|" My dear child, you reunited me with my beloved Marianne. I can never thank you enough. "
"Wang Fu"|"Marianne"|0.783736228942871|" Yes, life in London has been quite wonderful."
"Marianne"|"Wang Fu"|0.558018326759338|" Would you believe it? Wang discovered a passion for painting. "
"Wang Fu"|"Marinette"|0.692172765731812|" Actually, as a thank you for helping me, I want to give you this painting. "
"Marinette"|"Wang Fu"|0.520074844360352|" Thank you. It's... really... Uh, am I holding it the right way?"
"Wang Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.177961587905884|"Yes. I'm not sure myself what's supposed to represent.But when I think of you, this is what I see. So, there you go.What's this?That's such a cute little doll. Is it yours? "
"Marinette"|"Wayzz "|-0.756428450345993|"Yes! It probably fell out when I took out the cake. "
"Wayzz "|"Marinette"|0.457735061645508|"HE TOUCHED ME! HE TOUCHED ME!"
"Marinette"|"Wang Fu"|-0.211200058460236|"I didn't show you! It talks too.He touched me! He touched me!So, what are you going to do while you're visiting Paris?"
"Wang Fu"|"Marinette"|0.286971211433411|" Paint, of course.Montmarte, the Tuileries gardens, the banks of the Seine. Is there any better place to paint than Paris?Go on. Don't mind me. "
"Marinette"|"Marianne"|0.348967432975769|" Another slice of cake? "
"Marianne"|"Roaar"|0.202150106430054|" Please. "
"Roaar"|"Xuppu"|0.394398927688599|" He looked as strong as a tiger!"
"Xuppu"|"Daizzi"|-0.379239857196808|" Unusual painting, though."

"Barkk"|"Su-Han"|-0.498557448387146|" I told you I had a bad feeling about this. "
"Su-Han"|"Marinette"|-0.228183567523956|" How come you are in possession of the Mother Box, young lady?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.478250741958618|"Who are you? "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.598873019218445|"That's Grand Master Su-Han. The celestial guardian of the Miracle Box. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.159818112850189|" But I'm the guardian of the box. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.309422612190247|" Celestial Guardian was in charge of it before that incident caused by Master Fu. "
"Marinette"|"Su-Han"|0.593523025512695|"How did you find me?"
"Su-Han"|"Marinette"|0.328274607658386|" The guardians' staffs hold compasses that allow the boxes to be tracked at all times. "
"Marinette"|"Su-Han"|-0.728695571422577|" Hey! That's not fair! Why didn't I get a staff?"
"Su-Han"|"Marinette"|-0.728032171726227|" Precisely because you are not a true guardian! This is all a misunderstanding, and the incorrect shape of the box proves it."
"Marinette"|"Su-Han"|-0.286521971225739|" But I don't get it. Master Fu entrusted it to me."
"Su-Han"|"Marinette"|-0.751174181699753|" FU?! As in Wang Fu, also known as Whiny Chicken Leg?! That incompetent disciple unable to spend one entire day without eating, or do a thousand finger push-ups?! Fu should never have been a guardian. That low-life never lived up to the hopes that were placed in him."
"Marinette"|"Su-Han"|0.348335862159729|" Master Fu may have made mistakes when he was young, but he bravely protected the box for years! He even sacrificed himself and erased his own memory to save us!And now, he's become a great painter!"
"Su-Han"|"Marinette"|-0.777425989508629|" That old man is Whiny Chicken Leg?! Wait...Some kwamis are missing."
"Marinette"|"Su-Han"|-0.554246097803116|" When Master Fu gave the box, he already lost butterfly and the peacock. "
"Su-Han"|"Marinette"|-0.796262100338936|"He's lost a Miraculous too?!He's even more incompetent than I thought.PLAGG! Young girl, where is Plagg?!"
"Marinette"|"Su-Han"|-0.0173652768135071|" That I know. Cat Noir is his holder."
"Su-Han"|"Marinette"|0.120814681053162|"And who is Cat Noir?"
"Marinette"|"Su-Han"|-0.519845962524414|" Well... I don't know, since we're supposed to keep our identities secret."
"Su-Han"|"Marinette"|-0.518335223197937|" So this is the modern world: protected by a group of careless fools. Guardians must never wear a Miraculous! Some jewels missing and Plagg roaming free?! The end of dinosaurs and dragons - doesn't that alarm anyone?!That's enough! Kwamis, get in ying-yang patterns and back inside the box. "
"Marinette"|"Su-Han"|0.0587928295135498|" What are you doing?! "
"Su-Han"|"Marinette"|-0.0378597974777222|" Let me remind you about some of the Perfect Precepts that you have broken.Precept 14: Kwamis must not live outside the box.Precept 52: Guardians must never lose a Miraculous.Precept 133: A guardian cannot, under any circumstances, wear a Miraculous. "
"Marinette"|"Su-Han"|-0.303602933883667|" But Master Fu wore one himself!"
"Su-Han"|"Blue Knight In Movie"|-0.603274077177048|" Precisely! That just proves what I've been saying all along! Neither you nor Fu were up to the role of Guardian, because neither of you have respected the ancient absolute rules of our order! Not to mention the fact that no child should be a keeper of kwamis! They are ultra-powerful cosmic entities! One must manage them with authority, which you are obviously incapable of doing! "

"Su-Han"|"Marinette"|-0.639213144779205|"Challenging me like this is akin to pulling on the tiger's whiskers, you villain! "
"Marinette"|"Su-Han"|-0.689834803342819|"Whoa! Easy there. Calm down! It's just a movie. See?"
"Su-Han"|"Marinette"|0.322300314903259|"Such a powerful spell! How did that warrior end up in this flat prison of glass and metal?Anyway, we must waste no more time! Take me to Cat Noir, young lady."

"Su-Han"|"Ladybug"|0.438628196716309|"Of course, another child."
"Ladybug"|"Su-Han"|0.402225136756897|" Cat Noir, this is-."
"Su-Han"|"Cat Noir"|0.381021499633789|"I am Grand-Master Su-Han, the Celestial Guardian of the Mother Box."
"Cat Noir"|"Su-Han"|-0.294780790805817|"What? Aren't you supposed to be guardian M'lady?"
"Su-Han"|"Cat Noir"|0.590174674987793|"When the lion speaks the cub listens! First off you two are going to hand over your Miraculous to me."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.740195691585541|" What, that's a bad joke.And I know all about bad jokes."
"Ladybug"|"Su-Han"|-0.691108167171478|" We can't do that! How are we going to defeat Shadow Moth without our Miraculous?"
"Su-Han"|"Cat Noir"|0.450695991516113|" I will reassign then to carefully selected, appropriate adult holders. Like any rightful responsible Guardian would do."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.25600528717041|" Wait a minute. We can't just give our Miraculous to some guy who just showed up out of the blue."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0775114893913269|" I..I don't know. The Kwamis confirmed that he's the real original guardian of the Box. Maybe Grand-Master Su-Han is right. Maybe Master Fu is wrong.Maybe that's the reason why we can't defeat Shadow Moth."
"Cat Noir"|"Su-Han"|-0.365320801734924|" That's ridiculous! You'll always deliver! Trust yourself, Ladybug, like I trust you. If I have to give my Miraculous back then fine, I will. But only if you ask me to. You're the only Guardian here."
"Su-Han"|"Ladybug"|0.512701630592346|" Then it's settled. Order him to give you his Miraculous back and let's be done with this. Then you will renounce being the Guardian so I can retrieve the Mother Box."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.449648261070251|" But... if I do it, will my memories get erased like Master Fu's?"
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.443339765071869|"Does that mean you won't remember me?"
"Cat Noir"|"Su-Han"|0.585403680801392|"You want my ring? Then come and get it!"
"Su-Han"|"Ladybug"|0.198688626289368|" Fine."
"Ladybug"|"Su-Han"|-0.626005411148071|" Cat Noir, calm down. That's a Guardian you're talking to. We're gonna find a solution. "
"Su-Han"|"Cat Noir"|0.199367761611938|"Why do you think guardians study for so many years? Just to hand the Miraculous out to whomever? No. We are specially trained to overpower the Miraculous holders who have gone rogue, like YOU!Celestial Storm! The thousand fists of the Yama bring in the bearings wiped out! "
"Cat Noir"|"Su-Han"|0.296602606773376|"Master Fu was way nicer."
"Su-Han"|"Ladybug"|-0.730868071317673|" And his Mira-Kung Fu was worse. "
"Ladybug"|"Su-Han"|0.512560725212097|" Grand-Master, the last I heard, I was the Guardian! And I say that Cat Noir keeps his Miraculous, and I keep mine!"

"Su-Han"|"Marinette"|-0.492717742919922|"Involving Marianne in the fight - a human without powers was against the precepts too.This has proven two things: the first thing is that you have the audacity to invent your own rules, and, as crazy as it may seem, somehow they all work.The second thing is that your natural instincts tell you who you can trust - an essential quality for a guardian. Whiny Chicken- uh, sorry.. Master Fu may not have made such a bad choice after all.The Miracle Box is the mother of all boxes. It's the very first one that was created, and the one that holds the most powerful magic jewels. I cannot imagine what would happen if it were to fall into the wrong hands. But I am going to trust you.I will keep watching you from a distance, but be wary - one failure and I will take the Miracle Box back.I will make the most of my time here in Paris to get accustomed to modern life. How can I be a good guardian if I don't try to understand the world around me? "
"Marinette"|"Mullo"|0.689721703529358|" Thank you, Master. I have something for you too. I think you're gonna need these. "
"Shadow Moth"|"Gabriel"|0.369664549827576|" Ladybug, ever since you became the guardian of the Miraculouses, something has been different, and believe me I will find out exactly what it is."
"Gabriel"|"Alya"|0.0639388561248779|" Tonight, Emilie, our rings will once again be united. I've invited your sister and Félix. I have every intention of getting back what he stole from me."
"Alya"|"Félix"|0.691724300384521|"The Miraculous are magical jewels that give powers to superheroes, like Ladybug's earrings and Cat Noir's ring. But supervillain Shadow Moth also has two Miraculous brooches in his possession, and they will give him his powers. We can figure out from this that the Miraculous can either make a superhero or a supervillain. It's all riding on who wears it, which is why these jewels can't fall into just anybody's hands. That's all for today, guys! See you soon, and stay connected!"
"Félix"|"Amelie"|0.289010047912598|"I hope we'll get to see some superheroes while we're here in Paris, mom."

"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.432393908500671|" I can't, the members of the club wouldn't understand. Also, Félix will be here with Amelie."
"Nathalie"|"Nathalie"|0.6744624376297|" I've made a list of everything that has to get done tonight."
"Nathalie"|"Nathalie"|0.375580787658691|" You'll just need to follow the instructions. The most important things are in red.Check the staffs' identities, make sure the robots are set to the proper program and don't forget to activate the cellphone scramblers, so the party stays private."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.631229162216187|" Have you had lunch?"

"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.311854004859924|" Yeah, so?"
"Marinette"|"Mylène"|0.402217268943787|" So they all know about me and...how I feel about you know who?"

"Nathaniel"|"Marc"|-0.314348340034485|" Adrien is probably the only one who doesn't know."
"Marc"|"Alya"|-0.569793969392776|" Of course, otherwise there would be no story."
"Alya"|"Rose"|0.383985280990601|" We chose Marc and Nate, 'cause as you know, they're the experts in romantic comedies. Marc writes and Nate draws."
"Rose"|"Marc"|0.677795767784119|" And, since they succeeded in inventing a love story for Ladybug and Cat Noir in their first comic book, they're sure to think of the perfect plot between you and Adrien!"
"Marc"|"Nathaniel"|-0.358462631702423|" Your story with Adrien seems really complicated."
"Nathaniel"|"Marc"|-0.0993072986602783|" But it's actually very simple."
"Marc"|"Marc"|0.431643724441528|" It's just like a fairy tale. Nate?"
"Marc"|"Rose"|-0.0912474989891052|" Usually, a mean old witch imprisons a princess in a castle guarded by a dragon. And a knight in shining armour has to save her. Well, this is the same story, except you're the knight, Marinette, Adrien's the princess, the castle is his home, and the witch is his father, Gabriel Agreste."
"Rose"|"Alix"|-0.107836067676544|" I'd have thought his father was the king."
"Alix"|"Zoé"|-0.345423102378845|" Or the dragon."
"Zoé"|"Mylène"|0.501185297966003|" His bodyguard would be the dragon, he looks the part!"
"Mylène"|"Nathaniel"|-0.548418134450912|" He looks more like a gorilla."
"Nathaniel"|"Marc"|-0.536835372447968|" The main obstacle in the fairy tale could be the dragon."
"Marc"|"Alya"|-0.578039526939392|" Or the witch! In Marinette and Adrien's story, it's Gabriel Agreste. But the witch Agreste has made a mistake! He's been letting his son out of the castle to go to school!"
"Alya"|"Marc and Nathaniel"|0.582465291023254|" And that's where the good fairies come in!"
"Marc and Nathaniel"|"Marc"|-0.490797758102417|" Us!"
"Marc"|"Marinette"|0.344673752784729|" Every week, we'll think of a new plan, so that the knight can finally kiss the princess! And they can finally live happily ever after with buckets of hamsters! And the plan will always take place in the one and only location where the witch can't get to, which is..."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.0442401170730591|" The school!"
"Chloé"|"Rose"|-0.428969204425812|" A-ha! You forgot me in your ridiculous fairy tale!"
"Rose"|"Mylène"|-0.499157845973969|"The terrifying ogre!"
"Mylène"|"Alix"|-0.532556921243668|" The big bad wolf!"
"Alix"|"Chloé"|-0.739900231361389|" The ugly toad!"
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.782059162855148|" Your worst nightmare!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.075225830078125|" Thanks to this video, I'm going to ruin Dupain-Cheng's fairy tale! Tonight, I'll show this video to his father, who will realize that you're trying to take his son away from him and make him fall in love with a baker girl! Then he'll lock Adrien up in his room forever and forbid him to come back to school, and poof! There goes your fairy tale! Adrien will never see you again! Good for him!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.133011758327484|" I thought you're happy that Adrien was coming to school?"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.476208925247192|" He'll be better off alone at home than surrounded by a bunch of lame-o's at school! And then maybe he'll be lucky enough to go back to being my Prince Charming whom I've always adored!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.277425050735474|" Adrien was never your Prince Charming, Chloé!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.00340414047241211|" We'll see about that, Dupain-Cheng! Sabrina, ninja smokescreen!"
"Marinette"|"Zoé"|-0.668925404548645|" She won't do anything. Not tonight, or ever. The witch— I mean, Gabriel Agreste, doesn't just let anyone walk into his house."
"Zoé"|"Marinette"|-0.156251847743988|" Normally, that's true, but actually, there's a dinner party tonight, and all his friends are invited, with their children! Chloé will be there."
"Marinette"|"Zoé"|-0.535372644662857|" Yeah, but so will her mother, who's your mother, so you'll be there too! You'll be able to stop her, right?"
"Zoé"|"Marinette"|-0.471529901027679|" My darling half sister Chloé managed to convince her mother not to bring me with them."
"Marinette"|"Marc"|0.341801762580872|"She really is a piece of work..."
"Marc"|"Zoé"|-0.465488851070404|" We just have to pretend like we're in a fairy tale! The knight simply has to go to the ball to stop the evil Chloé from showing the videos to the witch Agreste!"
"Zoé"|"Marc"|-0.591901957988739|" The knight can't get into the ball. The ball is off-limits, tonight."
"Marc"|"Nathaniel"|-0.391538619995117|" Unless, the knight is wearing..."
"Nathaniel"|"Zoé"|-0.602952152490616|"A disguise!"
"Zoé"|"Butler Jean"|-0.591677933931351|"Jean Quinton, did my mother tell you that the dinner party is no longer at Gabriel Agreste's tonight?"
"Butler Jean"|"Zoé"|-0.517053216695786|" Oh no! Madam didn't mention anything to me."
"Zoé"|"Butler Jean"|-0.0589022040367126|" A helicopter will be coming to the roof, to take you over to the Eiffel Tower."
"Butler Jean"|"Zoé"|0.5759437084198|" Is mademoiselle sure about this?"
"Zoé"|"Zoé"|-0.177491307258606|" Excuse me? Are you suggesting that I might be wrong?Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!Sorry, but it's for a good cause."
"Zoé"|"Marc"|-0.369930326938629|"The butler is out of the picture."
"Marc"|"Rose"|0.551568388938904|" The knight can take his place!"

"Marinette"|"Zoé"|0.340078353881836|" Waitress in sight."
"Zoé"|"Marinette"|0.302914142608643|"Good luck, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Sarah"|0.45119571685791|"Hi there."
"Sarah"|"Marinette"|-0.611643075942993|" Uh..."
"Marinette"|"Sarah"|-0.723666995763779|" I'm Marino.Sorry I'm late, they let me know at the last minute that I had to take over for the regular waiter 'cause... he's sick!"
"Sarah"|"Marinette"|0.447309851646423|" Oh! Nice to meet you. My name is Sarah. Here's the deal, this is a very private party with very important people! We have to be invisible. The only contact we'll have with Gabriel Agreste will be when he takes our fingerprints to check our identities."
"Marinette"|"Rose"|-0.262252330780029|" Ah— uh... check our identities?"
"Rose"|"Sarah"|0.284529805183411|"Was this part of the plan?"
"Sarah"|"Marinette"|0.359846234321594|" We're just here for food prep in the kitchen and overseeing the children. The robots will be serving the adults. Follow me, everything will be fine."
"Marinette"|"Gabriel"|0.256920099258423|" I've got the muscles, I'll carry the heavy stuff. Don't you worry, partner!"
"Gabriel"|"Marinette"|0.612814664840698|" Thank you."
"Marinette"|"Zoé"|0.513161778450012|" I'm in!"
"Zoé"|"Audrey"|0.661717414855957|"Yes, well done!"
"Audrey"|"Gabriel"|-0.0700368285179138|" How come you're doing all the work tonight, Gabriel? If you needed more servants, you just have to ask us to lend you more."
"Gabriel"|"Chloé"|-0.451330900192261|" Welcoming you is never work, dear Audrey."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.482304811477661|"Mr. Agreste, I need you to show you a video, it's really important that you see this!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.698882311582565|" Woaah! Oh no!"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|0.0368363857269287|" My phone!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.689926475286484|" I guess you dropped this."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.527856588363647|" Thanks—Oh— I mean, thanks."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.360862016677856|" Do I know you?"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.579574912786484|" Not likely, I don't know anyone."
"Chloé"|"Gabriel"|0.622045874595642|" Hey! You have to watch this, are you ready?"
"Gabriel"|"Chloé"|-0.627559095621109|" I don't have time for this, young lady."
"Chloé"|"André"|-0.596719831228256|" But—"
"André"|"Amelie"|0.433585405349731|" Come along now, sweetheart. Gabriel is obviously busy."
"Amelie"|"Gabriel"|0.632134914398193|" Gabriel! I'm so happy to be able to thank you in person for giving our family's ringback to Félix."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.652273893356323|" It was the sensible thing to do, Amelie."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.63511049747467|" That was very thoughtful of you, Father."
"Marinette"|"Sarah"|0.709956645965576|" I can handle serving the youngsters, I've always been good with kids."
"Sarah"|"Zoé"|-0.682429075241089|" I'd rather you stay in the kitchen."
"Zoé"|"Marinette"|-0.661456882953644|"Show her she's making the wrong choice, Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Sarah"|-0.748577922582626|" Oh, no! I'm so clumsy!"
"Sarah"|"Chloé"|0.444597840309143|" Okay, you take care of the kids."
"Chloé"|"Félix"|-0.451973557472229|" Oh look, it's the fake Adrien! If I was anyone, other than Chloé Bourgeois, you might actually have me fooled!"
"Félix"|"Chloé"|-0.558104336261749|"You're wrong, Chloé, I am Adrien!"
"Chloé"|"Félix"|-0.751354411244392|"Oh! I'm so sorry, Adrikins!"
"Félix"|"Chloé"|-0.569243669509888|"You're still just as foolish as ever, Chloé Bourgeois."
"Chloé"|"Gabriel"|0.756724834442139|" Mr. Agreste! Is now good? Do you have time to look at my film?"
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|0.325313329696655|" All cellphones will be secured safely for the duration of the evening."
"Gabriel"|"Alya"|-0.325352013111115|" I'm sure you understand how essential privacy is when important business is on the line."
"Alya"|"Alix"|-0.0750314593315125|" They've got a soundwave scrambler in the house!"
"Alix"|"Gabriel"|0.166245460510254|" I'm sure she can handle it."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.528379678726196|" Adrien, show your young friends up to your room."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.263217926025391|" Yes, father."
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|0.365255832672119|" Félix. May I see you for a moment?"
"Gabriel"|"Félix"|-0.409781217575073|" Why did you steal my ring, Félix?"
"Félix"|"Gabriel"|0.112441301345825|" Mom really wanted me to have it since it belonged to her family.But you really wanted to keep it, so I planned on giving it back to you tonight."
"Gabriel"|"Félix"|-0.496680021286011|"Hmm. Your mother will be sad if you do that."
"Félix"|"Gabriel"|-0.644047260284424|" Don't worry, uncle.She won't know. I had a copy made."
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|0.497590065002441|" You're an intelligent young man, Félix."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.711674779653549|" I know each and every scratch on Emilie's ring! It's a fake ring!He gave me a fake ring! How dare he?!"
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|0.694118976593018|"Hey, Félix! Are you coming?"
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.245664596557617|" Akumatize him, then make him tell you where he's put Emilie's real ring and get it back."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.177325010299683|" If I do that, he'll know that I'm Shadow Moth.Who else would want that ring?"
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.220748782157898|" You're forgetting how immense your powers are now. You can be the Gabriel who creates negative emotions and the Shadow Moth who akumatizes them at the same time."
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|0.706093430519104|" Brilliant idea, Nathalie."
"Gabriel"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.0255036354064941|" Duusu, Nooroo, dual metamorphosis!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.740535646677017|" No one tricks Gabriel Agreste. But you, my lovely amok, you will deceive that arrogant young Félix! And thanks to you, I will get my ring back!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Chloé"|0.46837306022644|"You're perfect!"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|0.412501096725464|"I need to find a phone. He has to watch my movie."
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|-0.708265572786331|"Chloé, you heard my father. Not during the party."
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|0.483414173126221|" He will thank me when he sees what I filmed."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.655423372983932|" Chloé, No!"
"Marinette"|"Félix"|0.598021149635315|"I will take care of it. I've always been good with young people."
"Félix"|"Sarah"|-0.00836843252182007|"I need to speak to my mother."
"Sarah"|"Marinette"|-0.440696537494659|"Marino, why do you have a cardboard box on your head?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.13451075553894|"Uh— it's to entertain the youngsters!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.390884876251221|"Where are you Chloé? You are here somewhere."
"Marinette"|"Sentimonster Gabriel"|-0.602071613073349|"She's looking for her phone! I won't let you do it."
"Sentimonster Gabriel"|"Félix"|0.416758060455322|"What are you looking for, Félix?"
"Félix"|"Sentimonster Gabriel"|0.659880995750427|"You. I'd like to get to know you better, uncle."
"Sentimonster Gabriel"|"Félix"|-0.59631735086441|" It's true. You don't know me very well at all, otherwise you wouldn't have given me a fake ring. Where did you put the real ring? The one that belongs to my wife?"
"Félix"|"Sentimonster Gabriel"|0.374067544937134|" In a safe place."
"Sentimonster Gabriel"|"Félix"|0.205619215965271|" Wherever it is, you're going to give it back to me."
"Félix"|"Sentimonster Gabriel"|-0.0381052494049072|" How do you plan to make me do that, by using your powers... Shadow Moth?"
"Sentimonster Gabriel"|"Félix"|0.0253136157989502|" I am Gabriel Agreste, and I do indeed have every power I need to find my wife's ring, including the power to destroy your life. I don't need to be Shadow Moth for that."
"Félix"|"Sentimonster Gabriel"|-0.119195640087128|" I knew you were no ordinary uncle."
"Sentimonster Gabriel"|"Félix"|-0.580707728862762|"And now you know that I only need to snap my fingers to make you disappear from here."
"Félix"|"Sentimonster Gabriel"|-0.582721054553986|" You wouldn't dare!"
"Sentimonster Gabriel"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.289507150650024|" Do you want to take that risk, Félix? Think of your mother."
"Shadow Moth"|"Félix"|0.386767029762268|"Félix, I am Shadow Moth. You've put yourself in an unfortunate situation by trying to defy someone stronger than you. But I can give you the power to escape Gabriel Agreste. All I ask in return are Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous."
"Félix"|"Sentimonster Gabriel"|-0.414821922779083|" This is impossible! I'm not mistaken. You are wearing a Miraculous. Those jewels are underneath your scarf, the brooches!"
"Sentimonster Gabriel"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.00751245021820068|" Brooches? What are you talking about?"
"Shadow Moth"|"Félix"|-0.209483861923218|"You really think that Gabriel Agreste could be Shadow Moth?He doesn't have what it takes! And neither do you. Accept the power I'm offering you!"
"Félix"|"Sentimonster Gabriel"|-0.55992579460144|" I'm not afraid of your threats, and I don't need your power!"
"Sentimonster Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.0749395489692688|" Come back!"
"Nathalie"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.648534685373306|" Use your anger to akumatize the sentimonster."
"Shadow Moth"|"Bob Roth"|-0.409088671207428|"Collector, you have failed in the task of getting that boy to tell you his secret. So, now I give you the power to take it by force."
"Bob Roth"|"Chloé"|0.494122624397278|" Hey! That's my phone!"
"Chloé"|"Collector"|0.246547937393188|" Mr. Agreste! I have to show you my video."
"Collector"|"Bob Roth"|-0.215051114559174|" I am now the Collector, and anyone caught in my tablet will give up their secrets to me!"
"Bob Roth"|"Chloé"|0.0368363857269287|" My phone!"
"Chloé"|"Collector"|-0.626464009284973|"I just wanted to show you this video to hurt the baker girl and keep Adrikins all to myself, because I'm a mean person.Why did I say that?"
"Collector"|"Bob Roth"|-0.404243767261505|"And you! What were you doing in the living room reserved for the members of my club? What secrets are you hiding?"
"Bob Roth"|"Kagami"|-0.25650018453598|"I steal people's ideas and then I-"
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.408660054206848|"Hide in here!"
"Adrien"|"Collector"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Collector"|"Marinette"|-0.477540135383606|"And you Félix! Where did you hide my ring?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.554696828126907|"Tikki! Spots on!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.417416453361511|" Hey M'Lady! Looks like the Collector is gone high tech."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.638441771268845|" I liked it better when he had a book. At least you had a limited number of pages."
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|0.109503269195557|"I will get him out of here."
"Cat Noir"|"Félix"|0.558701157569885|" What do you got that Collector wants it so badly?"
"Félix"|"Cat Noir"|-0.125166475772858|" My ring."
"Cat Noir"|"Félix"|0.288052678108215|" If it's yours, why would he want to take it from you?"
"Félix"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0261698365211487|" I don't know. My uncle is a strange man."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.440293312072754|"Whoa! I hope that statue takes up a lot of memory."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.601509571075439|" That's right! The memory on that tablet is going to fill up pretty fast!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.380455851554871|" Stay here Félix."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0314657688140869|" -or not. Lucky Charm!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.250126421451569|"Way to bounce back, m'Lady."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.579972743988037|" Want to help me to set up the table, kitty cat? "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.521718144416809|" So, what's for dinner?"
"Ladybug"|"Collector"|-0.355124890804291|" A Collector!"
"Collector"|"Ladybug"|-0.13104522228241|" My appetite is insatiable! You will fall before me!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.632423281669617|" Cat Noir! Time for a rebound."
"Cat Noir"|"Collector"|0.48083221912384|"Dinner's ready!"
"Collector"|"Ladybug"|-0.636263519525528|" Nooooo!"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|-0.582838207483292|" No more evil doing for you, little Akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha! Bye-bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug!"
"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Ladybug"|-0.657591015100479|"I'm so sorry. The memory of my wife made me vulnerable. That ring was all I had left of her but you can keep it, of course! After all, I did give it to you."
"Ladybug"|"Shadow Moth"|0.384854316711426|" Keep this magical charm with you. It may not heal your pain but it will keep Shadow Moth from using it against you."
"Shadow Moth"|"Chloé"|0.73978066444397|"Thank you, Ladybug. You can't imagine how much this means to me."
"Chloé"|"Bob Roth"|0.2416090965271|" Mr. Agreste! Mr. Agreste! Now you have to watch my video!"
"Bob Roth"|"Chloé"|-0.00421220064163208|" Hang on there a minute, young lady! That's my phone."
"Chloé"|"Bob Roth"|0.568556547164917|" And it's my video."
"Bob Roth"|"Chloé"|-0.729037284851074|" Oh yeah?There. Deleted!"
"Chloé"|"Bob Roth"|-0.590350151062012|" No... Nooooooo!"
"Bob Roth"|"Shadow Moth"|0.130103230476379|" Now it's only my phone. Have a nice rest of the evening, everyone!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Shadow Moth"|0.184151291847229|" So... that is what's changed, Ladybug. I release you from existence."
"Shadow Moth"|"Gabriel"|-0.682621657848358|" Reverse morphosis. "
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.626281380653381|" I want to know how Ladybug was able to create this magical charm."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.135702133178711|" I haven't read anything about it in the spell book."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.266315042972565|" What if... the book was only a chronicle of what has been discovered up until now."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.648583501577377|" So that's why there are blank pages at the end."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.614712476730347|" This means that the power of the Miraculous is even stronger than we thought."
"Nathalie"|"Marinette"|0.688663959503174|" As is yours."
"Marinette"|"Marc"|0.281192541122437|" Oh, guys! What a night!"
"Marc"|"Marinette"|-0.0621095895767212|" It gave us an idea for another plan, Marinette. Nate? So we thought—"

I have to... stop playing."
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.613598644733429|" Stop playing? But Marinette, playing is like that little pinch of salt in baguettes. It makes life tastier."

"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.758080393075943|" What Dupain-Cheng is trying to tell you, using this ridiculously fake excuse of hers, is that she doesn't want to play your dumb, little video game. In fact, no one wants to, because everyone has a much more interesting life than you do. Even Marinette, which is really saying something."
"Marinette"|"Max"|-0.668893337249756|" No, this isn't a fake excuse at all. I really do have a Jagged Stone poster to knit for Kitty. No! To post a Stone. Uh, to Stone a Jag. Uh... ah! I'm late! "

"Kim"|"Marinette"|0.462510704994202|" Actually, the tryouts offer a partner to team up with Max in the Tournament."
"Marinette"|"Kim"|0.178922533988953|" Why Max?"
"Kim"|"Marinette"|-0.00814801454544067|" 'Cause he's unbeatable! He's a total rocksord! He's got the highest APM over anyone!"

"Max"|"Marinette"|0.664813280105591|" Hmm. Awesome job. We're gonna make a killer combo."
"Marinette"|"Kim"|0.48809802532196|" So let me get this straight. If someone manages to beat Max's score, they'll team up with Adrien at the tournament?"
"Kim"|"Alya"|0.543774724006653|" No one can beat Max. Or rather Max and Adrien. It's a slam dunk. They're our school's dream team!"

"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.512542486190796|" Just imagine, teaming with Adrien!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.445560812950134|" Are you out of your mind, girl? This is about stepping up and representing! Not snuggling up and snogging! This is serious business!"
"Marinette"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.359546720981598|" Seriously Alya, you think I'd actually go through with that?"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Marinette"|0.15328049659729|" Well, I think we have our two champions lined up for the Paris tournament."
"Marinette"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.128220081329346|" Wait! Uh, Is it too late... to try out?"

"Marinette"|"Max"|0.352057933807373|" Please... Every time you win, you loot its items and gain XP, which upgrades your mech. I'm not a noob, thank you very much."
"Max"|"Chloé"|0.394112229347229|" Ah, sounds like you have a sufficient amount of knowledge. Let's see if it's enough to beat me."
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|0.150113224983215|" Seriously? How could anyone spend so much time in front of a screen?"
"Sabrina"|"Kim"|0.500463128089905|" I know, as if. "
"Kim"|"Marinette"|0.662074208259583|" Come on, Max, you can do it!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.460466742515564|" And now, a quarter super plus heavy kick, and Flying Hyper Storm! Triple hit combo, Marinette style! Booyah!"
"Marinette"|"Kim"|0.684774875640869|" Woo! Yeah! Woo hoo! I win! Uh-huh!"
"Kim"|"Alya"|-0.604564875364304|" Wha! I can't believe it! She... she beat him?"
"Alya"|"Rose"|-0.661838591098785|" Beat him? She pulverized him!"
"Rose"|"Max"|-0.600051194429398|" The king's been knocked off his throne!"
"Max"|"Adrien"|-0.138599336147308|" I accept this defeat. I relinquish my position at the tournament. Congratulations, Marinette. And Adrien."
"Adrien"|"Kim"|0.367133498191833|" Max, wait!"
"Kim"|"Max"|0.282931447029114|" Oh, Max..."
"Max"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.620470017194748|" Look. I'm fine, I lost fair and square. But if you don't mind, I'd like a little solitude."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Adrien"|0.590034365653992|" So, Marinette Dupain-Cheng and Adrien Agreste will represent Françoise Dupont High School at the Paris Ultimate Mecha Strike III Tournament. Good luck to both of you."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.646642565727234|" Well, I guess I'll be coming over to practice. With my new partner. See you later."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.586945176124573|" See... ya..."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.458325028419495|" Now you gotta win and you're gonna be representing the school, not just hanging out with Adrien."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.365924119949341|" Oh, Adrien..."
"Alya"|"Max"|0.119248986244202|" Oh, brother... "
"Max"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.739032775163651|" This is a travesty. An unequivocal travesty!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Max"|0.0276855230331421|"Ah, a competition. I know you like that, my little evil akumas. Where there's a winner, there's always a loser.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize him!"
"Max"|"Hawk Moth"|0.0575066804885864|" I should've been going to that tournament. I was the chosen one! I worked so hard for it! Inconceivable!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Max"|0.534643650054932|" Gamer, I am Hawk Moth. I'll help you win the tournament of your life. But in return, you must help me achieve my high score."
"Max"|"Marinette"|0.726093411445618|" Absolutely, Hawk Moth. Game on! Now to see who's the greatest gamer in Paris! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.307604193687439|" Ah, training with Adrien! Adrien!"

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.363350868225098|" You know how much Max wanted to be in that tournament. Kim said he'd been training for it all year."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.550598561763763|" Right. All I could think about was Adrien. Hey! Adrien's coming to my house.Adrien's coming to my house! No, this is a total disaster! I have to... clean my room!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.226794719696045|" That's what I've been trying to tell you all along."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.624596744775772|" Oh, this... is not... happening!!"
"Tikki"|"Sabine"|-0.515594393014908|" Calm down, Marinette. You still have time. It's not like he's gonna show up this very minute."
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.460311651229858|"Marinette! Someone's here to see you!"

"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.293192803859711|" Uh, Marinette. A little snack wouldn't hurt, would it?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.652079433202744|" Uh, I'm really sorry. It's impossible to get anything down with my parents around."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.424259305000305|" That's okay.I didn't know your dad made such yummy pie!"

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.412289381027222|" Could you keep it down, m'lady?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.665274858474731|"Romantic comedies are lame anyway, and you know why? It's totally not realistic! In real-life, the girl would take forever to tell the guy she loves him without stuttering. Bla-bla-bla! So how can see she know if he loves her back? It's impossible, so then she decides she can never ever be with him, and then BAM! She falls in love with another guy, and everything is so cool. Almost too easy, no stuttering, they hold hands, they get all kissy-kissy, and then, SURPRISE! She has secrets! And him, he hates secrets, of course. So as they break up, and everyone lives un-happily ever after, the end. And that's why romantic comedies are so lame. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.643838703632355|"So sorry, we'll be going now."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.132612586021423|" Stay AWAY from the romantic comedy, go for heroic heroes instead. Special effects, heroes saving the world, no feelings, no questions, nobody talks because there is NOTHING to say! That is good entertainment for sure."

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.738346368074417|" Listen m'lady, I didn't get everything you said and obviously, I know nothing about your private life, but I do know what heartbreak sounds and feels like, and-"

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.652624845504761|"You know, if you ever want to talk about anything, I'm here for you."

"Aquabug"|"Alya"|-0.668997555971146|" Stop, I'm not sad and these photos don't bother me, at all. They're just shots of fashion and friends, and I love fashion and I love my friends, so it's all good.There's no problem, see?"
"Alya"|"Rose"|0.166649341583252|" So, Marinette's got a problem. Her heart's been broken. At first Marinette is crazy about Adrien but she's never been able to tell him about her feelings because well.. she's Marinette and he's.. well.. Adrien. Then comes along Luka, Marinette can talk to him because he's.. well.. Luka. So they start dating."
"Rose"|"Alya"|0.701335310935974|" They were so cute together!"
"Alya"|"Juleka"|-0.435503304004669|" Yeah, except they broke up."
"Juleka"|"Alya"|-0.752031281590462|" He was like super sad when they did."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.640167862176895|" But the real problem here is that Marinette never told us anything. If Luka hadn't told Juleka, who told Rose, who told Mylène, who then told Alix, who finally told me. Then I, her BF in the whole world would still be in the dark! Yesterday I was in the restroom and I heard her crying."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.595855176448822|" Marinette? Have you been crying?"

"Rose"|"Alix"|-0.516886115074158|" Why is she keeping all these secrets from us? "
"Alix"|"Mylène"|-0.726446360349655|" If she's not even telling Alya, then there's a real problem!"
"Mylène"|"Alya"|-0.102053880691528|" What do we do? "
"Alya"|"Girls"|0.531576156616211|" What Marinette needs is a friendly intervention. Let's all call her up together and see how she's doing. "
"Girls"|"Alya"|-0.566077440977097|" Rabbit check! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.711653470993042|" She's not picking up."

"Alya"|"Girls"|0.506206870079041|"We were just calling to tell you that we're here if you need to talk, whenever you want, wherever you want, call us back!"
"Girls"|"Barkk"|0.518523216247559|"We love you, big hugs!"
"Barkk"|"Wayzz"|0.408076047897339|" We gotta do something! "
"Wayzz"|"Trixx"|0.429643988609314|" We need Tikki! "
"Trixx"|"Aquabug"|0.124760627746582|" I got this! Why aren't you using the talking light box to speak to your friends? "
"Aquabug"|"Trixx"|0.119245648384094|" About what? Everything's fine."
"Trixx"|"Aquabug"|-0.570639967918396|" Don't you think you should detransform then? "
"Aquabug"|"Trixx"|-0.529314279556274|" No, I'm better off like this, if Shadow Moth attacks Paris, I'll already be ready for action at any time."
"Trixx"|"Aquabug"|-0.605829179286957|" Yes, but what about Tikki? She might need to rest a bit, or maybe eat something."
"Aquabug"|"Marinette"|-0.752559617161751|"Oh no! Tikki, spots off! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.260174989700317|"Are you okay Tikki? "
"Tikki"|"Alya"|0.437740802764893|" Better than you, Marinette. We should have a little talk. "
"Alya"|"Mylène"|0.734452247619629|" Maybe we should go to her house. What do you think? "
"Mylène"|"Mylène"|0.571744799613953|" We'll give her an eternal friendship bracelet so she never forgets that friends can tell each other anything and that we'll always be there for her. "
"Mylène"|"Alix"|0.577451348304749|" I read in a magazine that an ancient South American tribe did something like this. You tell a secret to the bead in your mind, once Marinette adds her secret to the bead this bracelet will unite us all forever. Ready?"
"Alix"|"Alix"|0.150372266769409|" Seriously, wouldn't it be more logical to take her out for a smoothie and help her work out her love problems? "
"Alix"|"Marinette"|0.48602294921875|" Okay."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.237516164779663|" As long as I'm Ladybug, I can't have loved ones in my life."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.218761265277863|" What makes you say that Marinette? "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.644749283790588|" You know why. I had to break up with Luka because I couldn't tell him the truth, it'd be the same thing with Adrien. I can't share my secret with either of them. I can't be honest with my closest friends or my parents about anything. I'm doomed to be a big liar to everyone, forever. What do I do Tikki? "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.481319427490234|" I wish I could tell you but... kwamis don't fall in love."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.44289243221283|" You see? No one can help me. My life as Marinette is too complicated. I should just be Ladybug all the time! Tikki, spots on! "
"Alya"|"Rose"|-0.30734521150589|" Marinette? Marinette? "
"Rose"|"Mylène"|0.447740197181702|"Wow! Check this out girls! This is new! Oh, it's so cute!"
"Mylène"|"Alya"|0.584571480751038|" Another one of Marinette's cool creations."
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.641873955726624|" She must be up on the patio, I'll go get her."
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.152555108070374|" What are you waiting for, Shadow Moth?! Here I am! "
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette? "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.683466970920563|"Spots off. "

"Rose"|"Marinette"|0.42988133430481|" Aw, it looks just like a real house, look how the roof comes off to show the inside!"
"Marinette"|"Rose"|-0.66590803861618|"No! No, don't touch that! Move away! "
"Rose"|"Marinette"|-0.685720473527908|"Sorry, Marinette! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.442539811134338|"Will you please leave my room?! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.601444572210312|" Chill out Marinette, it's just a doll house. We'll totally help. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.643038898706436|" No you won't, please go!"
"Alya"|"Mylène"|-0.699006885290146|" Okay Marinette, there's clearly something wrong and we're not leaving you like this till you tell us what it is."
"Mylène"|"Marinette"|0.551048159599304|" Each of us told our secrets to this bracelet. It's your turn now."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.738218247890472|"The only thing that's wrong right now is you guys still hanging out in my room, which is not cool!"
"Alya"|"Rose"|0.606067895889282|" If we're really your friends, you can confide in us."
"Rose"|"Marinette"|-0.611247003078461|" Real friends don't ever let each other down. "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.636204123497009|"Well then maybe I don't want you to be my friends, GET OUT!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.260188102722168|"I had no choice Tikki, I had to do it. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.318144500255585|"I know, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|-0.624172955751419|" At least now I won't have to lie anymore, since, there'll be no one to lie to. "
"Sabine"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.0917354226112366|" Is everything okay? Girls? "
"Shadow Moth"|"Alya"|0.0829415321350098|" Several fragile hearts that break all at the same time. What a lovely symphony for my akumas.Fly away my akuma, and evilize them! "

"Mylène"|"Rose"|0.257142901420593|"I really thought it would work."

" Marinette"|"Ladybug"|-0.499254763126373|"Tikki, spots on! Ah! "
"Ladybug"|"Trixx"|-0.806822180747986|" When a kwami uses their power without a holder to channel its energy, doesn't it often set off some kind of catastrophe? "
"Trixx"|"Trixx"|0.332117080688477|" My power creates Illusions,so the side effects will hopefully just be in their imaginations. "
"Trixx"|"Ladybug"|0.153344869613647|" Oh come on, her Miraculous Ladybug will make everything alright anyway.I hope. "
"Ladybug"|"Nadja Chamack"|-0.430493056774139|" Oh Trixx… "

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.534648418426514|" They're looking for Marinette Dupain-Cheng, one of their classmates."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.0859712958335876|" Haven't we already saved her a bunch of times? Funny you'd think everybody would like her."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.690842151641846|" Well apparently, she's managed to alienate all her friends at once. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.312888264656067|" You still there? "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.153096079826355|" Just thinking. With five villians it's not gonna be easy finding the object that has the akuma. "

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0251615047454834|" I'm going to isolate one of the villains from the others and get her to tell me where the akuma is. Meanwhile, you find Timebreaker to stop her from going back in the past, otherwise she could really screw up my plan."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.59279990196228|" Good luck, M'lady. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.667834997177124|" Thanks, you too."
"Cat Noir"|"Timebreaker"|0.546764731407166|" Hey, it's been awhile. How's it ticking Ms. Time Keeper?"
"Timebreaker"|"Lady Wifi"|-0.698424130678177|" It's Timebreaker. And I don't have a second to lose talking to you. "
"Lady Wifi"|"Ladybug"|-0.657933741807938|" Ha, bummer for you, Ladybug. I don't have the akuma."
"Ladybug"|"Lady Wifi"|-0.50019696354866|" No biggie, I just wanted to talk to you anyway."
"Lady Wifi"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.554233431816101|" I've got nothing to say to you."
"Shadow Moth"|"Cat Noir"|-0.627879112958908|"Your friend, Lady Wifi is having some trouble with Ladybug. "

"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.479308605194092|" Alya, from what I understand, you've been having some issues with your best friend. Her name's Marinette, right?"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.0974206924438477|" I don't know what happened between the two of you, but I wanna tell you about a friend of mine. She's a superhero. You know Rena Rouge right? "
"Ladybug"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.372729063034058|" Of course, we keep secrets from one another, mainly because of my secret identity, but even though we can't tell each other everything, we trust each other. And that's why we can fight side by side. You can reject the power that Shadow Moth gave you."
"Shadow Moth"|"Ladybug"|-0.271080672740936|"Don't listen to her Lady Wifi. If you do that, you'll never know your friend's secrets! Or Ladybug's! "
"Ladybug"|"Shadow Moth"|0.629410743713379|" I trust you completely Alya. And I need you! I.. need Rena Rouge! "
"Shadow Moth"|"Ladybug"|-0.71623820066452|"That's.. impossible!"

"Alya"|"Ladybug and Alya"|0.47096836566925|" It's 'cause you're an amazing friend, Ladybug. "
"Ladybug and Alya"|"Cat Noir"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it."
"Cat Noir"|"Shadow Moth"|0.162129402160645|" Ladybug, the Gang of Secrets is looking for you, I'm on it, but I don't know how long I can hold them off all by myself."
"Shadow Moth"|"Ladybug"|-0.514494717121124|"Your friend Lady Wifi has betrayed you, she chose Ladybug's side. Hurry up and seize his Miraculous so you can take care of the bug!"
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.106151223182678|" Which object holds the akuma? "
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.0633999109268188|" It's in a bracelet. Timebreaker must have it, but you and Cat Noir will never be able to take on four villains at once."
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.349873304367065|" I think this calls for the master of Illusion. "
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.209653973579407|" Woah! How'd you do that? "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.648828625679016|" There have been a few upgrades since I became Guardian of the Miraculous. "

"Ladybug"|"Marinette"|0.639820694923401|" You know, without you and Cat Noir, I wouldn't have made it through today. I'm really lucky to have friends like you. So, thank you. "
"Marinette"|"Rose"|-0.533917635679245|" It's true, breaking up with Luka broke my heart. And never being able to tell Adrien how I feel is just as painful. Love is too difficult. I think- I think I'm gonna stick to friendship, that's about all I can handle right now."
"Rose"|"Mylène"|0.636907577514648|" Take your time."
"Mylène"|"Alya"|0.332162857055664|" It'll all work out. "

"Alix"|"Alya"|0.418378710746765|" Bye! See ya tomorrow. "
"Alya"|"Alya"|0.649549245834351|" You go ahead girls, I just have one last thing to say to Marinette. "
"Alya"|"Alya"|-0.553388357162476|" You didn't tell us everything, did you? A journalist and a BFF can tell these things. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.256654024124146|" I won't try to figure it out or force it out of you.If you can't tell me what's in your heart, it's your right."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.078727126121521|" Will we still be friends? "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.730573147535324|" Marinette. I'm your best friend, and I'll always be. That's why it kills me that I can't help you with whatever's making you feel so alone."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.666031926870346|" Alya, wait! Stay. You're right, I am alone.More than ever before. I can barely take it anymore! You know why I broke up with Luka? Not because I don't like him, he's amazing! It's 'cause there's something that I can't tell him. You know why I have to forget Adrien? For the exact same reason! You're right, I keep secrets, I lie all the time! I lie to my friends, to my parents, to everyone and the worst thing is, I can't do it any other way!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.137965798377991|" There's always another way. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.615397781133652|" No, not this time. I have no choice. All this is bigger than us, Alya. Way too big."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.0598435401916504|" If it's too big, two of us can handle it better than one."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.730763703584671|" If I tell you, things will never be the same between us again.It'll mess up everything, maybe even destroy it."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.601065516471863|"Marinette, I'm your very best friend."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.292773842811584|" And I… I'm Ladybug. "
"Alya"|"Alix"|0.357013344764709|" Thanks for showing up, girls. So, check this out. I've got the...biggest...scoop! But FYI, it's seriously hush-hush. Top secret, classified information."
"Alix"|"Alya"|0.402828931808472|" You know who Ladybug is? "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.17698872089386|" No, but it's almost as hot. Marinette is—"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.252682089805603|" Wait, Alya.Do you really think this is such a good idea?"
"Alya"|"Girls"|-0.355740308761597|" I don't think it is, I know it is. But remember, girls, your lips are sealed. Got it? "
"Girls"|"Alya"|0.0354734659194946|"Mm-hmm."
"Alya"|"Alix"|0.668195486068726|" Well, Marinette is head-over-heels for somebody."
"Alix"|"Marinette"|-0.132497668266296|" Yeah, Adrien."
"Marinette"|"Mylène"|0.196523427963257|" What? But how did you know?"
"Mylène"|"Marinette"|-0.31017529964447|" Well, it is pretty obvious."
"Marinette"|"Rose"|0.451272368431091|" So, do you think...I mean...Adrien knows too?"
"Rose"|"Girls"|-0.697179168462753|" No way. Boys never pick up on things like that."
"Girls"|"Alya"|0.0354734659194946|"Mm-hmm."
"Alya"|"Rose"|0.561968803405762|" Right, so let's get down to business. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to arrange a ridiculously romantic date between Marinette and Adrien."
"Rose"|"Alix"|0.759610295295715|" Oh, that's so sweet!"
"Alix"|"Juleka"|0.70619523525238|" Great!"
"Juleka"|"Mylène"|0.0965572595596313|" Big time!"
"Mylène"|"Marinette"|0.656421065330505|" We know we can always count on you, Marinette; so you can count on us too."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.57423734664917|" Aw, thanks, girls."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.19933807849884|" You're up, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Mylène"|0.505726933479309|" Alya and I have come up with a plan. It's called \"Operation: Secret Garden\"."
"Mylène"|"Alya"|-0.0608291625976562|" Excuse me, but why do we need a plan? I mean, can't Marinette just go up to Adrien and ask him out?"
"Alya"|"Rose"|0.39784574508667|" Seriously, Mylène? This is Marinette we're talking about here. Now, each one of you will have a codename based on a flower. Alix, you'll be \"Violet\". Mylène, you'll be \"Sunflower\". Juleka, you'll be \"Rose\". And Rose will be \"Tulip\". "
"Rose"|"Alya"|0.0420030355453491|" Um, why isn't my name \"Rose\"?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.225377917289734|" Because \"Rose\" is your real name."
"Marinette"|"Rose"|0.0514179468154907|" It won't be a codename if we call you \"Rose\".This afternoon, \"Buttercup\" has a photo shoot at the Trocadéro fountains."
"Rose"|"Alix"|-0.560151398181915|" Hmm..."
"Alix"|"Rose"|-0.388314068317413|"Adrien!"
"Rose"|"Marinette"|-0.587292939424515|" Ah!"
"Marinette"|"Mylène"|-0.297127246856689|" His security guard, a.k.a. the \"Nanny\", will be waiting for him in the car on the other side of the esplanade, in the \"chariot\". He's supposed to take \"Buttercup\" back home after the photo shoot, except that's not gonna happen. This is where you guys come in.Step one: \"Rose\" will have a fake \"No Parking\" sign. She'll go over to— "
"Mylène"|"Rose"|-0.0635163187980652|" Um, who's \"Rose\" again?"
"Rose"|"Alya"|0.0838514566421509|" Me, of course!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.292583525180817|" No, Rose. It's Juleka. You're \"Tulip\".\"Violet\". \"Sunflower\". \"Rose\". \"Tulip\". "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.303089618682861|" So, step one: \"Rose\", you put the fake sign next to the \"Nanny's chariot\"."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.279722273349762|"Step two: \"Sunflower\", you'll go find a police officer and say to him:\"Hello, Mr. Police-Officer. Oh, look! That car's parked illegally\".\"Well, you don't say! I shall enforce the law right this second! Thank you, young lady.\""
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.124634921550751|" Step three: No more \"Nanny\".Step four: \"Tiger-Lily\" will let us know as soon as \"Buttercup\"'s done with his photo shoot."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.508624583482742|"\"Tiger-Lily\"."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.3303582072258|"But, instead of meeting up with the \"Nanny\", Adrien's gonna find..."
"Alya"|"Rose"|0.245191931724548|" \"Lotus\"!"
"Rose"|"Alix"|-0.36951071023941|"That's Marinette!"
"Alix"|"Marinette"|-0.541245847940445|"But when \"Buttercup\" sees that the \"chariot's\" gone, he'll just text his \"Nanny\", won't he?"
"Marinette"|"Alix"|-0.681307822465897|"Impossible. \"Buttercup\" always leaves his personal items in the car when he's on a photo shoot, even his phone!Such a professional!"
"Alix"|"Rose"|-0.227446973323822|"She knows everything about Adrien! Creepy, no?"
"Rose"|"Marinette"|0.762511849403381|" Yes! It's so romantic!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.249481558799744|" So then..."
"Marinette"|"Alix"|0.297117114067078|"\"Hey, Marinette!\" (They walk closer to each other, rickshaw driver to come and park in the Nanny's car spot, then all I need to do is say to Adrien— "
"Alix"|"Alya"|-0.146039009094238|"Bdi-di-di-di, di-di-di-di, di-di-di-di-di-di-di-dii! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.178290963172913|" You're right, that's usually how it goes!"
"Marinette"|"Mylène"|0.610112071037292|" But this time I'm really ready! I've got you guys with me. I'm gonna do it, I promise!"
"Mylène"|"Alix"|0.65489399433136|" You're gonna be great!"
"Alix"|"Marinette"|0.64404833316803|" Wooo! Yeah!"
"Marinette"|"Rose"|0.745115756988525|"So I say to him, \"Since your car's not here we might as well ride home together. Hey, look! What a co-inky-dink! There's a rickshaw right here!\"\"Awesome idea, Marinette! I've always dreamed of going on a rickshaw with you!\"We take a really romantic ride along the banks of the Seine and over the Pont des Arts bridge, where we just happen to run into André, the sweethearts' ice cream maker!Then, \"Violet\" skates by and showers us with rose petals!It's gonna be perfect!"
"Rose"|"Alya"|0.600340604782104|" It's...it's... so beautiful!"
"Alya"|"Juleka"|0.0366884469985962|" Any questions?"

"Mr. D'Argencourt"|"Mr. D'Argencourt"|0.462910175323486|" Get into position! "
"Mr. D'Argencourt"|"Mr. D'Argencourt"|0.563751578330994|" En garde, prêt, allez! "
"Mr. D'Argencourt"|"Kagami"|-0.485716223716736|" Attaque, touche. Point."
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.74715381860733|" Me defeating you all the time is normal. But just anyone defeating you worries me. If you have a problem, let me help you."
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.328688681125641|"No one can help me, Kagami."
"Adrien"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.627870112657547|"Can you stop here, please?"
"Shadow Moth"|"Gabriel"|-0.611073613166809|" I feel a devastating disappointment,a sense of guilt!Adrien?Reverse morphosis! "
"Gabriel"|"Marinette"|0.239479422569275|" Your job is to drive Adrien back home immediately after his fencing class. Go get him! Now! "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.45053768157959|" I don't call that a monetizing informational space, sir, I call it visual pollution!How much would it cost to get that poster removed?That much?? Can I pay in thirty-five hundred installments?Adrien?Uh— Yeah, but um... go ahead and leave the poster there. Bye! Love ya— Uh— I mean, goodbye!Tikki! Adrien is sad! \"Operation: Bye-bye, Blues\" is a go!!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.415209293365479|"A present for Adrien's name day, for the mock final exam of the year, in case he ever gets a cast... quick! We got to get to the park before he leaves!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.521703720092773|"Is it this one?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.516931653022766|"Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.330249190330505|" Oh, Adrien! Fancy seeing you here! And you look so sad, that's good! I mean, no, of course, it's not. It's sad that you're sad but I just happen to be at shopping, and have with me by an incredible coincidence the perfect thing to bring back your smile. So, umm... gift! "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.63628613948822|" Oh, uh, thanks!Wow! I've always dreamed of having a hamster! How did you know they were my favorite animal? You read my heart like no one can, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.482488036155701|" It's... It's 'cause I love you, Adrien."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.613847494125366|"In that case, you must know what my heart wants more than anything right now."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.587476491928101|" No, what?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.630567759275436|" A hamster wheel!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.300593376159668|" No! This one is just in case they bring back the film or... oh— where— nothing.This wasn't the perfect gift at all!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.58675742149353|" That's a shame. A cool gift like that could be useful."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.594384610652924|" It's not cool or useful! The garbage can is the perfect place for useless stuff that you can just forget about."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.65749180316925|"The garbage can, right.I have to go. Bye, Marinette. "
"Marinette"|"Gabriel"|-0.780598327517509|"I've messed everything up again!"
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.310430884361267|" I'd like to speak to you, Adrien."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.67015278339386|"As you wish, Father."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.367853820323944|" Umm, is everything alright?"
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.263217926025391|"Yes, Father."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.693798333406448|" Good.Adrien, since your mother disappeared, I... must've been distant, but..."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.76376847922802|" I don't blame you, Father."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.552889227867126|" I want you to know that, if you needed to, you could... talk to me. "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.271252989768982|" If I needed to, Father, I would. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.624672174453735|" Wow! Your father actually said three whole sentences! All those warm feelings, enough to melt a wheel of raclette! Oh, raclette cheese! What a great idea!"
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.703401327133179|"I don't wanna be like my father, tied to a memory of something that can never be again! Plagg, claws out!"
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.709120243787766|" I'm worried about Adrien. His sword has lost its edge."
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|-0.167034447193146|" His what? "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.113366901874542|" Since you're both so weak, I mean sensitive, you understand him best and could him be happy again."
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|-0.640645027160645|" I'm not weak— "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|0.33678925037384|" You must hurry and declare your love for him, so that the flow of your kind words waters the sharpening stone that's his heart again. And that way, Adrien will get his edge back."
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|-0.726080477237701|" I didn't get a th— "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.563159942626953|" The problem is that your technique to get Adrien to fall for you is terrible. The art of attraction is like combat, and to win in combat you need training. You are Tori, the attacker, so you need Uke, the defender."
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|-0.165413796901703|" Tori? Uke?"
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.52953115105629|" You need to find someone you have no feelings for. That way you can practice your attraction techniques with that person without your emotions getting in the way."
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|-0.152280032634735|" Isn't that a little weird?"
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|0.146063327789307|" Weirder than what you usually do? It's a proven technique. Very, even books written about it."
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|-0.659350335597992|" But what if... the person I'm practicing on falls for me? Since I don't feel the same way, couldn't there be awful consequences?"
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.44380134344101|" That's why you must be sure that the person you pick has zero chance of falling for you. I'm counting on you."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.263340294361115|" But who can I find to do this weird Tori-Uke thingamajig with?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.615306496620178|" I can play Adrien if you want!"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.68026065826416|" That's sweet of you, Tikki! I may be imaginative, but I think I'll need at least a human on this one."
"Cat Noir"|"Plagg"|-0.477716445922852|" Cataclysm!Claws in! "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.449934899806976|"Have mercy! You know I love cheese, but even I'm starting to get sick of it!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.493760347366333|" We must cataclysm all traces of my love for Ladybug! "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.536423116922379|" All of them?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.39817488193512|" No... nope... no, that'd be way too weird. Ugh, it's impossible! I'll never be able to find anyone to practice on!Oh! Cat Noir! He's the perfect choice! There's no way he has any feelings for me— well, for the other me, yes, but not for the real me me!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.219448983669281|" Isn't it kind of strange that he's out here all alone when nobody has been akumatized?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.286517739295959|" Aw, cat on a rooftop, what could be more normal? Hide, Tikki!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.624045819044113|" Cat Noir!"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.210002303123474|" Here, kitty, kitty!"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.529102385044098|" Marinette Dupain-Cheng, is everything okay?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.735917210578918|" Yeah, perfect timing, actually! I need a boyfriend."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.547871679067612|" A boyfriend? Oh, no no no! I'm done with all that lovey-dovey stuff! I'm not in love with anyone, and don't plan it on anytime soon."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.0188788175582886|" Then, that's perfect! Exactly what I need. See, I have a problem with my boyfriend, who's not my boyfriend yet, because I can't talk to him about how I feel, so I need someone to play my crush, who for sure doesn't have a crush on me, and you'd be perfect for the role since there's no way you'd fall for me, since you don't love anyone!"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.57141587138176|" No one, exactly! And I mean no one! But, uh, I still don't get it. You need me to do what exactly?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.316077053546906|" To play my boyfriend who's not my boyfriend yet! And I'll play the girlfriend, but the girlfriend who does things right, who doesn't mess up everything she says. Know what I mean?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.0766337513923645|" Uh, not much more than before?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.672109484672546|" Great! Let's do this then.You sit there, and I'll come in.Dear Cat Noir, ever since I met you, I've had three suns in my heart. They shine so brightly that whenever I see you, they make me melt until the slightest thought has reduced to droplets! Those suns are only three little words, but they're burning my lips! Please soothe me, Cat Noir, and tell me that you love me as much as I love you—"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.624702095985413|" Uh, Marinette? Sorry, I'm really flattered, but, like I told you, I'm not in love with anyone."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.385689735412598|" Of course! I'm not talking to you! This is for the boyfriend who's not really my boyfriend yet!"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.587326884269714|" Ah, got it! But since you said Cat Noir, I thought you were actually talking to me."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0810903906822205|" Oh, right, shoot!"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.115119934082031|" Well, what's your boyfriend's name?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.648828059434891|" Uh— that's private..."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.714291661977768|"That's not gonna make things any easier."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.125198125839233|" Okay... Buttercup."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.410151362419128|"His name is \"Buttercup\"?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.134888291358948|" Of course, that's not his real name, it's a code name! Come on, start over.Dear Buttercup, ever since I met you, I've had three suns in my—"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.714937776327133|" Come on, would you please concentrate? This is serious!"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.510288059711456|" Sorry! It's the Buttercup name. "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.792640805244446|" Dear Buttercup, ever since I met you, I've had three suns in my heart. They shine so brightly that whe—"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.779587149620056|" What's with the face? Are you hurting or something?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.639712274074554|" Uhh, I'm being serious."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.707740515470505|" Uh, well, okay, that's not being helpful at all. Be serious, but not serious like you're trying to solve a math problem."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.536799073219299|"Dear Buttercup, ever since I met you, I've had three suns in my—"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.6100192964077|" I'm sorry, Marinette, but what face am I supposed to make then?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.519930154085159|"Who cares!?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.697072923183441|" I don't know, you're the one who was saying—"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.254953026771545|" I know! It doesn't matter how you feel right now, I'm the one training here! Just act like you're a little interested in me! It's good to be interested in other people now and then, you know? Always me, me, me!Let's start over."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.761312007904053|"Dear Buttercup!! Ever since I met you, I've had three suns in my heart. They shine so brightly that whenever I see you, they—"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.739739298820496|" Woah, that's the most beautiful thing anyone has ever said to me!"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.540832668542862|" But I hardly said anything!"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.183023571968079|" I know, but the way you open your mouth was just so moving, it was like the skies after the storm, like a rainbow sweeping my heart!"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.765463605523109|" You're overdoing it."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.354171574115753|" You think?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.16965639591217|" Yes. Really. "
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.699100852012634|"Dear Buttercup! Ever since I met you, I've had three suns in my heart. They shine so brightly that whenever I see you—What is it now!?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.684474885463715|" Uh, well, if you don't mind me saying, now it sounds like you're mad at me instead of in love with me."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.360943853855133|"I'm not mad! I'm declaring my love to you, isn't it obvious?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.22807776927948|" Let's just say it could be more obvious."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.637851119041443|" Alright, since you're so good at this, show me how it's done. I'll be you, and you'll be me. Come on. "
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.693970680236816|" Dear Buttercup, ever since I met you, I've had three suns in my heart. They shine so brightly that whenever I see you, they make me melt until the slightest thought has reduced to droplets! Those suns are only three little words, but they're burning my lips! Please soothe me, Buttercup, and tell me that you love me as much as I love you!"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.250464737415314|"Wait a minute, do I sound that corny when I'm saying it?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.660647064447403|" I'm just performing, you know? I'm not here to judge the wording."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.778710424900055|" Oh man, this is awful! I'll never be able to do this."
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir and Marinette"|-0.538995981216431|" Boy, you sure like to take the hard route. You put too much pressure on yourself. Of course, you'll be able to do it. I know, let's take a short break, just to air our heads out."
"Cat Noir and Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.127699375152588|" Movie?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.626324683427811|" Is there a problem?"
"Cat Noir"|"Bus driver"|-0.380717098712921|" Well, actually, I always travel by stick, I don't have change for a ticket."
"Bus driver"|"Cat Noir"|0.420656323432922|" This one's on me, Cat Noir! You've saved us so many times, it's the least I can do."
"Cat Noir"|"Bus driver"|0.195401310920715|" Thanks! I me-owe you one!"
"Bus driver"|"Commuter"|0.178354859352112|" You're welcome!"
"Commuter"|"Cat Noir"|0.667132019996643|" Bravo, Cat Noir, bravo!"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.168388605117798|" What movies are playing?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.255930423736572|" \"Little Love Notes\". We're trying to think of something else, so no romantic comedies. \"Captain Supreme: the Ultimate Duel?\""
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.705595105886459|" Could we possibly avoid films about superheroes?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.110397815704346|" Got it. What about \"Sharktank vs. Mechatiger\"?"
"Cat Noir"|"Mechatiger"|-0.325442492961884|" With a title like that, I think we should be safe!"
"Mechatiger"|"Sharktank"|0.209094166755676|"Sharktank, don't die! I've always loved you!"
"Sharktank"|"Cat Noir"|-0.719536989927292|"Me too, Mechatiger, but it's impossible! We're sworn enemies!"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.486611425876617|" But they don't even have mouths! How are they supposed to kiss?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.0654503107070923|" Uh, it's been written in advance, so everything's planned out. But in real life, you have no idea how it's gonna go. Just because you tell someone you love them doesn't mean the other will love you back just like that!"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.260035634040833|" Tell me about it. If only love could be so easy."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.207968473434448|" That's why it's so scary to tell someone you love them. Even saving the world seems easy comparing to it. Well, I suppose it is. I mean, just look at you! When you have to save the world with Ladybug, you just bulldoze ahead, you don't think about it! A couple of jokes, and bam! Cataclysm, Lucky Charm, Miraculous Ladybug! And everything's back to normal. Easy as pie."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.512044429779053|" Yeah, that's the short version, but it sounds about right."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.630469381809235|" But telling someone you love them? If it doesn't work out, it's your heart that gets cataclysm-ed, and no Miraculous Ladybug can repair that. That's why I never get anywhere with boys. When things are really important to me, I get so scared that it won't work out that I can't help trying to control every possible outcome! I tell myself stories with wedding dresses, and hamsters, and what people see is not Marinette opening her heart up. It's Marinette talking about some ridiculous nonsense she's made up."
"Cat Noir"|"Audience"|0.573670506477356|" I like hamsters, too."
"Audience"|"Marinette"|0.724182605743408|" And I like to watch the movie in peace and quiet!"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.420541644096375|" You have an umbrella option in your stick?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.713900834321976|" Well, yeah! Cats don't like water.It's funny, you know? I'm kind of the opposite of you. I know that Ladybug is not in love with me, but I can't help telling her how I feel. I wish I could fall in love with someone else, but I can't. She's just so incredible! I'm so afraid I'm not the good person I thought I was, and now I've gone too far and she hates me."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.64956346154213|"She doesn't hate you."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.663167864084244|" She threw me in the trash today."
"Marinette"|"André"|-0.00823527574539185|" You're a good cat. I'm sure you'll figure out what to do."
"André"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.537515431642532|"But it can't be! Ladybug and Cat Noir are supposed to be made for each other. I've lost my connection with my ice cream! I don't understand what it's trying to tell me anymore!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0272263884544373|" Akumatization is like ice cream; once you've tasted it, you'll always come back for more!Fly away, my evil akuma, and bring me back two scoops of despair!"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.0516904592514038|" Thanks for flying Cat Noir Airways. We hope you'll be fe-lying again soon."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.55137836933136|"Thanks! That was nice."
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|0.759480953216553|" My pleasure."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.259697675704956|" Oh, wait! Your training!"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.345181882381439|" Oh, shoot! I forgot about that!"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.649423480033875|" Quick! Back into position. You can totally do it this time! I just know it!"
"Marinette"|"Glaciator"|0.4329754114151|" Dear—"
"Glaciator"|"Cat Noir"|-0.124089419841766|" Ladybug and Cat Noir are the ones who should be in love, not you two! My ice cream never lies!"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.234830260276794|" Again?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.419517576694489|" No, no, no! We're not in love, it's just practice!"
"Cat Noir"|"Tikki"|0.544360518455505|" Stay here. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.459914267063141|" Glaciator re-akumatized? But that's impossible! You gave André a magical charm earlier, didn't you?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.73717924952507|" Oh, no! I was so annoyed with that whole Couple of the Year thing that I totally forgot to give it to him! Tikki, spots on! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.504987239837646|" Nice to see you again, my... dear friend whom I respect and for whom I have no other feelings than true platonic friendship."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.65397971868515|" Are you making fun of me?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.664008527994156|" Not at all! I'm... just getting my bearings."

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.693798065185547|" Oh, yeah! That lucky charm really revs my engine!"
"Ladybug"|"Glaciator"|0.51960551738739|" Okay! Take the wheel. I got a plan."
"Glaciator"|"Glaciator"|-0.137410759925842|" There you are! You think you can escape me like that?"
"Glaciator"|"Cat Noir"|0.350393891334534|"I'm Glaciator, the mean ice-cream man, and I am your number 1 fan!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.423575282096863|"That's enough! We're just friends!"
"Ladybug"|"Glaciator"|0.153645515441895|" Okay. Let's go!Pass me the wheel."
"Glaciator"|"Cat Noir"|-0.303010940551758|" You think you can escape me by attaching me to you?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.552208542823792|" Where are we going with this—? I mean, not the two of us. Just... where are we going, like, a direction?"

"Ladybug"|"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|0.536582350730896|" I knew you could do it! "
"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.563960790634155|" Oh! I just remembered. I gotta hurry. I've got something I need to finish. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.679018139839172|" I better hurry, too."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.330384016036987|" This time's the one. You'll see! "
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.680400967597961|" Ever since I've met you, I've had three suns in my heart. They shine so brightly that whenever I see you... "
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.693344831466675|" That was a good start. What's wrong?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.179250538349152|" What's wrong is that this is not really me.The first time I saw you, I misjudged you. I thought you were conceited and superficial. But then, I got to know you. I saw who you really were deep down—someone sweet, sincere, and generous. Since then, there's something I've been wanting to tell you. But every time I try, it's like my brain suddenly freezes. But now, I think I'm ready. I love you."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.639970779418945|" Your declaration was beautiful, Marinette. The boy you're in love with is a lucky guy."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.697948455810547|" Thanks! The girl who falls in love with you will be lucky, too."
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.623125314712524|"Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.484582364559174|" My dad!"

"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.27643883228302|" Hey! What's going—"
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|0.280360579490662|" Did you do what I told you to?"
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|-0.499357759952545|" Uh— kind of? I mean, not yet."
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.440015017986298|" Good. I was worried, 'cause that's a very risky technique. When you start practicing with a boy, you could fall in love with him, and then you might run away together to a desert island where you might get attacked by zombie carnivorous plants."
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|-0.612575769424438|"What?"
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.666386067867279|"And I haven't even finished Volume 3 yet. But I think it gets even worse later."
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.463317036628723|" Hang on. You've been giving me advice that you got from a manga?"
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.393547654151917|" From \"The Robinsons of the Catastrophe\". Why shouldn't I?"
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|0.496419191360474|"Kagami, Kagami, Kagami. You really need to spend more time with me and the gang. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.744541615247726|" I thought you've given up with Ladybug?"
"Adrien"|"Parisian 1"|0.664569616317749|" Marinette opened my eyes. The thing is, I'm always doing my Cat Noir act with her. Maybe if I were my true self with Ladybug, she'd fall in love with me."
"Bus driver"|"Ladybug"|-0.727574616670609|"It's no good! The brakes are busted!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.188238143920898|" Ready, Cat Noir?"
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|0.558197021484375|" I'm always ready, my lady. Who needs brakes when they've got us?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.740920662879944|" So, uh, Ladybug? What would you say if you and I met up tonight for a little dinner? Rooftop style?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.550608038902283|" For dinner? As superheroes?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.289435803890228|" Well, uh, yeah. That's right. We're only together when we're saving Paris. I mean, wouldn't you actually like to get to know one another?"
"Ladybug"|"Bus driver"|-0.295068442821503|" I... That's so thoughtful of you, but I can't. I have to, uh, I already have plans with some friends."
"Bus driver"|"Cat Noir"|0.405997395515442|"Thank you.Thank you, Ladybug."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.519475102424622|" Well, if your plans end early, come and join me."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.188941836357117|" We'll see."
"Cat Noir"|"Sabine"|0.455038547515869|" I'll be waiting, my lady."
"Sabine"|"Tom"|0.594339609146118|" It was delicious, sweetheart!"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.634089946746826|" And as a dessert..."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.44848895072937|" Ta-da! "
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.661482512950897|" Wow! Uh, no thanks, Dad."
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.641670942306519|" But isn't this your favorite?"
"Marinette"|"Sabine and Tom"|-0.117173194885254|" And it still is, Dad!But...I told you I was going out with friends. We're gonna get ice-cream at André's—"
"Sabine and Tom"|"Sabine"|0.158332824707031|" Oh, Sweetheart's Ice Cream!"
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.233440279960632|" That was where your father asked me—"
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.566853284835815|" To marry him."
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.482205510139465|" He hid the ring in a scoop of vanilla ice-cream."
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|-0.226610064506531|" And you almost swallowed it too! "
"Sabine"|"Tom"|0.545091390609741|" They say that couples who eat ice-cream at André's will stay in love forever."
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.517430663108826|" By the way, Marinette, who are you getting ice-cream with? "
"Marinette"|"Tom and Sabine"|-0.129676818847656|" Oops, gotta go!Don't wanna be late, see you later, guys!"
"Tom and Sabine"|"Nathalie"|-0.568183451890945|" Ohhh..."
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|-0.548267096281052|" There's no point in waiting for your father, Adrien. He'll be eating in his office."
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|-0.578471153974533|"Then what's the point of keeping me here if he's never gonna show up, Nathalie? "
"Nathalie"|"Plagg"|0.263464450836182|" Don't forget to practice your piano before you go to bed."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.650323837995529|" You could've at least grabbed the piece of Camembert on that platter!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.543033361434937|"Fuel up, Plagg.Adrien may not be allowed out of the house, but Cat Noir is!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.586140394210815|" You seem in a hurry to get stood up."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.663797378540039|" She didn't say she wasn't coming."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.407354176044464|" But she didn't say she was either!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out! "
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.70056626200676|" Don't even give me a minute to digest my fooooood!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.371708273887634|" Hey, Alya!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.244926333427429|" Hey, Marinette! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.422033369541168|" Where's Adrien?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.756408676505089|" Don't get upset, okay? But Nino just got a text. Adrien's dad isn't letting him go out."
"Marinette"|"Nino"|0.187750697135925|" Once again..."
"Nino"|"Ivan"|-0.482922852039337|" Yo, Marinette!"
"Ivan"|"Mylène"|0.00455760955810547|" What's up, M?"
"Mylène"|"Marinette"|0.584457516670227|" How are you, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|0.114726066589355|" I'm fine. Thanks. Hehe. So, do you know where André is today?"
"Nino"|"Ivan"|-0.194927990436554|" The deal with André and his ice-cream cart is that you never know where he's gonna be.You gotta follow his clues to find out where he's going to set up. "
"Ivan"|"Nino"|0.671176314353943|" The first time Mylène and I wanted André's ice-cream, it took us three hours to find his cart!Do you remember? "
"Nino"|"Ivan"|0.569992065429688|" Hey! Someone posted a photo! He's on his way to the Pont des Arts."
"Ivan"|"Mylène"|0.516817331314087|" Let's hurry!"

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.4747633934021|" Why don't you go and get one, too, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.656440615653992|"What's the point? Adrien won't be coming."
"Tikki"|"André"|-0.203617811203003|" He might not be here, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying a yummy ice-cream and a fun night with your friends. And you could give me a taste, too!"
"André"|"Marinette"|0.544097304344177|" And how about this young miss?The pretty one who sighs. I have a flavor just for her! It's sure to make her smile!"
"Marinette"|"André"|-0.590468466281891|" Uh... Me?"
"André"|"Marinette"|0.65656840801239|" What's your name, dear? "
"Marinette"|"André"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette."
"André"|"Marinette"|0.710036635398865|"Peach pink like his lips and mint like his eyes. Eat this, my dear, and your love will materialize! "
"Marinette"|"André"|-0.598851650953293|"Uh...um. No! I- There's been a mistake! I'm not in love with anyone. And I think I just lost my appetite. "
"André"|"Ivan"|0.563403606414795|" Why of course you are, my little one. When there's love burning in one's heart, André knows it from the start. Enjoy your ice-cream, Marinette. I know he'll be here."
"Ivan"|"Marinette"|0.566127300262451|" Green eyes like mint... Who could that possibly be?"
"Marinette"|"Wayem's friend"|-0.658629149198532|"Thank you, but you've got it all wrong. I don't have a-Adrien? "
"Wayem's friend"|"André"|0.54039454460144|" Hey!You finally made it! That's great!"
"André"|"Marinette"|0.303583860397339|"André's ice-cream has always melted hearts. But the magic will only work if you eat it! I'll make you another one."
"Marinette"|"André"|-0.0963599681854248|"Thanks, but it's really not necessary."
"André"|"Marinette"|0.73297655582428|"Yes it is, my dear. See here? My ice-cream has brought everyone together. Every famous loving couple in Paris! Edith and Marcel, John and Serge, Olive and Tom! Your loved one is out there! Somewhere! All you need is to believe in the magic of André's ice-cream!"
"Marinette"|"Ivan"|-0.477571904659271|" You're very nice, André. But I don't have a loved one."
"Ivan"|"Marinette"|0.0606056451797485|" Who has green eyes?You think we know him?"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.581522971391678|" Lay off, Ivan. There's no one, okay?And I don't think there's something magical about your ice-cream. It's just... ice-cream."
"Nino"|"André"|0.437178611755371|"Hey, I was gonna get another one!"
"André"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.371353149414062|" But André's ice-cream always melts people's hearts.At least, it used to. "
"Hawk Moth"|"André"|-0.294513404369354|" A thwarted artist, his shattered dreams and the collapse of his whole little world. Quite chilling.Fly away, my little akuma, and freeze the heart of this ice-cream maker!"
"André"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.441676437854767|" I don't understand. It's never failed. Ever. "
"Hawk Moth"|"André"|0.584957361221313|"Glaciator, I am Hawk Moth. Revenge is a dish best served cold since they refuse to let them melt their hearts. I'm giving you the power to melt their entire bodies instead! I only ask a little favor in return: Get me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous."
"André"|"Glaciator"|0.443496704101562|" Ladybug and Cat Noir flavored ice-cream? It's a deal, Hawk Moth. I'll even give a double scoop!"
"Glaciator"|"Marinette"|0.772801876068115|" Hello! How about some ice-cream? Will that do? Enjoy it, it's just for you!Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.778575122356415|"What a disaster! I ruined the whole night for all of my friends! I was mean to André! I'm so lame."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.709952473640442|" You're not lame. You just overreacted a little. Just let it go. Tomorrow will be a new day!"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.654084742069244|" I'll never get to eat ice-cream with Adrien."
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|0.682390451431274|" She loves me.She loves me not.She loves me.She loves me..."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.0623084306716919|" Hello."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.624045819044113|"Cat Noir?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.632408231496811|" Sorry.I didn't mean to frighten you. "
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.371497929096222|" What are you doing here? Don't you have like superhero-y things to do?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.0155134797096252|" No, I don't feel like being a superhero tonight. And I also don't feel like being alone tonight. Would you mind if I hung out here for a little while?Marinette, right? We've bumped into each other before."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.614655643701553|" Yeah, a bunch of times. I mean- yes! We have. One time a super villain fell in love with me. Talk about bad luck."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.670710116624832|" Seriously. I seem to have bad luck in the love department myself."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0154696702957153|" Really? What kind?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.668323397636414|" Well, tonight, I had this special surprise all planned for Ladybug."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.658843517303467|" You're in love with Ladybug?!For real?So what was this special surprise?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.637764304876328|"It doesn't really matter. 'Cause she never showed."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.33029568195343|" Sounds like you and I both need a bit of cheering up tonight."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.737650811672211|" You? You've gotten your heart broken too?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.670961052179337|" Yup.Huh?"
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|0.66001558303833|"Hey, come with me.Close your eyes and hold on tight, okay? "
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.549287557601929|" Just give me a minute.Alright, you can open your eyes now."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.790062755346298|"Wow! Cat Noir, this is... beautiful!I'm so sorry."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.732605397701263|" Why? It's not your fault."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.764687299728394|" No— Yeah— I mean— What I mean is I'm very sorry for you because, um, you prepared all of this and then... she didn't show."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.156146287918091|" She told me she might not make it but I had my fingers crossed. I really wanted her to come."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.739656150341034|"Maybe she had a really good reason for not coming. Like, a problem or something."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.699813604354858|" You're only saying that to make me feel better."
"Marinette"|"Glaciator"|-0.679623961448669|" Yeah. I mean— No! I mean—Look out!"
"Glaciator"|"Cat Noir"|-0.744407057762146|" Marinette, party pooper, you're looking so sad and surly, but Glaciator will make it all better. Don't you worry!"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.0767695307731628|"What on Earth is that? Another supervillain in love with you?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.305832922458649|" No! That's André the ice-cream maker."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.394292116165161|" The Sweetheart's Ice-Cream guy? He isn't looking too sweet right now."
"Marinette"|"Glaciator"|-0.20091724395752|" It's—It's a long story."
"Glaciator"|"Cat Noir"|-0.43606972694397|"I'm Glaciator, the mean ice-cream man. Escape my fury if you can! I melt your hearts, but I was wrong, now I'll freeze your bodies so long! "
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.532252192497253|" Go inside, Marinette. I'm gonna lead him away from you."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.28662097454071|"Cat Noir! Thanks for cheering me up."
"Cat Noir"|"Tikki"|-0.400159955024719|" It was the least I could do. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.34986537694931|"Wow, I've never seen the sensitive side of Cat Noir before."
"Marinette"|" Marinette"|-0.743709743022919|" Yeah, maybe I was wrong about him. "
" Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.443314373493195|" Tikki, spots on! Ha!"
"Cat Noir"|"Glaciator"|0.60077691078186|" Hey, Snow Dude, you lookin' for me?"
"Glaciator"|"Ladybug"|-0.671810030937195|" Bad kitty! Where have you hidden Marinette?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.655265212059021|" Hello, Kitty. Did the bad guys leave you cold?"
"Cat Noir"|"Glaciator"|0.717948913574219|"How was your amazing evening with your \"friends\"?"
"Glaciator"|"Hawk Moth"|0.601184964179993|" I've never tasted superhero flavor before. I can't wait to serve myself a double scoop!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Glaciator"|0.684978246688843|"Don't forget what you promised me. Give me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!"
"Glaciator"|"Ladybug"|-0.0659660696983337|" I'm a man of my word, Hawk Moth.Come out now, or I'll bury Paris in an entire layer of ice-cream!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.5544313788414|" The ice-cream seems to fire out of his hand, and before André was akumatized, he served his ice-cream using a-a whatcha-ma-call-it!"
"Cat Noir"|"Glaciator"|-0.388260900974274|" The whatcha-ma-call-it's called an ice-cream scooper. That must be where he's hiding the akuma."
"Glaciator"|"Ladybug"|0.410021901130676|" It's been a bomb, but now it's time to turn you into popsicles!Once and for all! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.708956480026245|" That's weird. It looks like he's leaving the couples alone."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.716046929359436|" Too bad for us."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.708324462175369|" You don't understand. We know he doesn't attack couples so we could pretend—"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.306631028652191|" Pretend?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.576489567756653|" To be in love!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.761901721358299|" Sorry, Ladybug, it's not cool to play with people's feelings."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.801856458187103|" Are you mad at me because I didn't show up?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.598075389862061|"What do you think?"

"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.25041675567627|" I am. With my bodyguard or Nathalie, of course. But I'm not sure my father would've allowed me to see this particular movie."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.629245847463608|"Oh no! Please don't tell me it's a horror movie! I hate horror movies!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.318106770515442|" No, no. Don't worry. It's a very rare movie that I've never been able to see. It's not on the Internet and my father's hidden the only DVD somewhere at home. See, my mother played the leading role."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.389936327934265|" Wow. I had no idea."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.163860142230988|" It's only being shown once. Today, in this theater. I couldn't talk to my father about it, so I decided to sneak out, unnoticed. "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.722901701927185|" I don't think the \"unnoticed\" bit went too well, actually."
"Adrien"|"Commercial voice"|-0.265230059623718|" Oh well. At least I'll get to see it. Not to mention this is the first time I've ever come to the movies with a friend. "

"Max"|"Ivan"|-0.710994899272919|" We were worried! You've been in there, four minutes and 47 seconds when people usually spend an average of three minutes and 24 seconds in the bathroom."
"Ivan"|"Kim"|-0.674972504377365|" Well, I was about to tear the door off its hinges."
"Kim"|"Rose"|0.579972147941589|" I was ready to dive in and save you."
"Rose"|"Marinette"|-0.697815179824829|" I see how worried I've made you. Please forgive me, if I never told you about my illness before now, it's because it's not my problems that matter but the way I get through them that counts. And how do I get through them each day?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.206560254096985|" By giving them all cute little nicknames. "

"Ladybug"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.781474277377129|" The airflow is too strong! I can't hold back anymore!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Ladybug & Cat Noir"|0.103825449943542|" Yes! Ladybug, Cat Noir, you just go headfirst into my trap and you'll never escape from it! Your Miraculous are mine!"

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.628361463546753|" Wow, it's way cooler in here than on the outside."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.626511067152023|" I don't know. I have a strange feeling."
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|0.00671482086181641|" Look out! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.1809983253479|" It's like being inside a giant pinball machine."
"Ladybug"|"Ivan"|-0.395382106304169|" Yeah. But I think it's in multi-ball mode."
"Ivan"|"Cat Noir"|-0.663600623607635|"Everyone got captured because of me. Everyone got captured because of me."
"Cat Noir"|"Ivan"|-0.76694792509079|" What's wrong with him?"
"Ivan"|"Cat Noir"|-0.611359030008316|" Everyone got captured because of me. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.573999464511871|" Is it me or did he just turn into Reflekta?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.313923060894012|" She must have been re-akumatized by Shadow Moth. And that thing..."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.0432199239730835|" ...is her sentimonster!"
"Ladybug"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.585032612085342|" We've got to find out where Reflekta is hiding, she must be the one controlling it. Stay on your guard."
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Ladybug"|-0.523572474718094|" I never should have let them leave the classroom. I never should have let them leave the classroom. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.715487778186798|" The sentimonster is contaminating everyone with these purple balls."
"Cat Noir"|"Kim"|-0.319593131542206|" It's not gonna be easy finding the real Reflekta with everyone looking like her."
"Kim"|"Mylène"|-0.426968574523926|"If only I had worn my competition swimsuit, I would have been faster."
"Mylène"|"Ladybug"|-0.658573687076569|"I never should have let go of Ivan's hand."

"Nino"|"Cat Noir"|-0.577668637037277|"I can't even help my best bud face up to his old man..."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.573365807533264|"Oh, Nino...This is all our fault.If we've been able to stop Shadow Moth, the students wouldn't be caught in this trap."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.675905585289001|" Oh no, this can't be happening! Not now!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.726003736257553|"Cataclysm. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0680610537528992|" Cat Noir, no! We could turn into Reflekta and frozen like the rest of them, Shadow Moth will help himself to our Miraculous!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.620359778404236|" We should just give him our Miraculous."
"Ladybug"|"Rose"|0.161043524742126|" You're right, kitty cat. How could I ever believe that the two of us could take on such a powerful sentimonster by ourselves?"
"Rose"|"Rose"|-0.559939563274384|"Ladybug, Cat Noir, you guys are totally the best! I knew you'd come to save us!I'm sorry you had to come. It's all my fault, I'm not a good friend. I should have never told Juleka my secrets."
"Rose"|"Ladybug"|-0.36182427406311|"No, I must not be like that. Yes, I'm glad I did! That's what made us closer and stronger!Yes!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.371106863021851|"Of course, she's fighting her negative thoughts with positive thinking! That's what stops her from turning into Reflekta! We have to do the same. Cat Noir you can do this, you have to think positive, you're the greatest partner anyone could have!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.473843216896057|" Ladybug, do you really mean that?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.235817074775696|" Yes, I probably don't tell you this enough, but I couldn't do this without you. And it'd be a lot less fun too."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.387880206108093|" Why, that's a meowvulous thing to say!And you're just about purr-fect yourself, m'lady."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.617002606391907|"Nice to have you back, kitty cat."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.565600216388702|"You really think that we'll be able to get out of this one huh?"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.617009401321411|" Of course don't forget that I still have my.. Lucky Charm! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.00312340259552002|" Oh yeah, an ice axe of course, an ice axe to uh... "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.474401593208313|" You don't know what to do with it? "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.290287256240845|" Of course I do. I'm just keeping you in suspense."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.662998139858246|"I could try using my cataclysm, but sending a sentimonster out of control when you're inside the sentimonster... probably isn't the best idea, huh?"
"Ladybug"|"Rose"|-0.741021484136581|" Nope, it's not.All this negativity is messing with my brain, ugh!"
"Rose"|"Ladybug"|0.628894925117493|"Go Ladybug! Go Cat Noir! You're the best! You're gonna save my friend Juleka, because I totally believe in you."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.265011429786682|" Yes, but we need more positivity to do that.And I know just the person who can help us."

"Ladybug"|"Juleka"|-0.749729484319687|" Reflekta isn't here anymore to control them. Quick, where's the object the amok went into? You know, Shadow Moth's feather?"

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.313342690467834|" Aren't you gonna go and hide with her to get your Miraculous back m'lady?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.279784440994263|" She already did. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.723548293113708|" That girl is truly incredible!"
"Ladybug"|"Marinette"|-0.238352835178375|" She never needed a Miraculous to be a superhero."
"Marinette"|"Rose"|-0.68085914850235|" I'm taking my present back, you'll just have to wait until your birthday like everyone else.Oh come on, guys, she's not made out of glass."
"Rose"|"Chloé"|-0.533283144235611|"Oh no, I'm gonna pass out from laughter so someone take me to the nurse's office!"

"Jagged Stone"|"Jagged"|0.516379475593567|"Mah Miraculous!"
"Jagged"|"Bob"|0.562690258026123|"So, what do you think of the first single of my next album? Can you feel it, Bob? Isn't it killer?"
"Bob"|"Jagged"|-0.273681640625|" Not bad, Jagged, not bad. But if you really want to be making something killer, let's talk about this duet with Mr. XY."
"Jagged"|"Bob"|-0.693044811487198|" No way. He's not a rocker, he's a baby! I bet he doesn't even shave yet."
"Bob"|"Jagged"|-0.578030109405518|" Well, this \"baby\" just pushed you out of the number one sales spot."
"Jagged"|"Bob"|-0.632452428340912|" And? Doesn't make him a true musician like me. Penny thinks everything I'm doing's rock star material. She thinks I'm killer."
"Bob"|"Jagged"|-0.510271191596985|" Penny might be your agent, but I'm your real boss. Listen. Bottom line is that Bob Roth Records cannot afford to be number two in sales! Or rep a number two rock star! Get real, Jagged! You're going to have to modernize your music. Change the way you look. Get a whole new style!"
"Jagged"|"Bob"|-0.646091103553772|" You want to talk about real? I'm a genuine rock 'n' roller, Bob, not some pop star in diapers. I'm a real artist. Real talent! Even my hair is real. And that's what people love about me.Isn't that right, Fang? Yeah.And the artwork you came up with for my album is a waste of my time! Seriously, Bob, what is this trash? It looks like a perfume ad!"
"Bob"|"Jagged"|0.287315845489502|"And that's what people want these days!"
"Jagged"|"Bob"|-0.549964636564255|" Well, I don't. My album covers are raw to the bone, exuding the smell of sweat and leather!"
"Bob"|"Jagged"|-0.615615218877792|" You do know, don't you, that if your next album doesn't rate #1 on the charts, it'll be the last one you ever do with Bob Roth records."
"Jagged"|"Penny"|-0.718864381313324|" I'd rather put out nothing at all than sing some pathetic duet with a baby-faced nobody."
"Penny"|"Jagged"|0.700557827949524|" Bob, Jagged and I had an idea. Its concept is modern, but it also respects Jagged's own...rugged style."
"Jagged"|"Bob"|0.681751132011414|"The schoolgirl who made these glasses has some real talent. She totally gets my style. She's going to design the cover of my new album."
"Bob"|"Penny"|-0.319861054420471|" A schoolgirl?"
"Penny"|"Bob"|0.374288082122803|" See? That's just it. She's the same age as the target audience.Here's her address."
"Bob"|"Bob"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Bob"|"Jagged"|0.234699726104736|"Okay! But just think about that duet with Mr. XY."
"Jagged"|"Bob"|0.469447612762451|" Find that girl, Bob!"
"Bob"|"Marinette"|0.589011549949646|" So, are you interested?"
"Marinette"|"Bob"|0.608868360519409|" Uh...wait, wait, wait. Let me get this straight. You want...me to design the album cover for Jagged Stone?! My...all-time favorite singer?!"
"Bob"|"Marinette"|0.614899158477783|" That's right! Requested by Jagged Stone himself.I brought a few visuals so you can get a sense of what we're going for."
"Marinette"|"Bob"|-0.132934629917145|"This doesn't seem like Jagged Stone material. More like...a perfume ad!"
"Bob"|"Marinette"|0.700518012046814|" This is the direction of his new image. More modern, current!"
"Marinette"|"Bob"|-0.236777603626251|" ...really? Wow. I was thinking more along the lines of–"
"Bob"|"Marinette"|-0.492653608322144|"Don't think! This is what is selling these days."
"Marinette"|"Bob"|-0.786435604095459|" Uh...sure."
"Bob"|"Marinette"|0.642345905303955|" And one last thing, Marinette. We're in a hurry! We need your proposal by the end of the day. You up to it?"
"Marinette"|"Bob"|-0.00553339719772339|"Uh, yeah! Okay."
"Bob"|"Tom"|0.703954696655273|"See you later, then!"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.413470983505249|"My daughter, famous album cover designer. You're going to kill it! Marinette style. Boo-yah! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.743833482265472|"Oh, why does Jagged Stone want to change his style? XY's music is so cold and lifeless, repetitive, mundane, the total opposite of Jagged. And what I've just done here is...ugh...is so not my style either."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.110400795936584|" So why are you doing it, then?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.0671112537384033|" Because that's what I was asked to do."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.124400854110718|" Maybe you should follow your gut feeling. Do something that's really you!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.0887434482574463|" But you heard what Mr. Roth said!This is what's selling these days."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.234419226646423|" Yeah, but...Jagged Stone wanted you because of your style!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.694155722856522|" Augh, the pressure! I can't deal!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.163986921310425|" Marinette, superhero of France, defender of the innocent, fighter of all the rights, can't deal with the pressure?"
"Marinette"|"Jagged"|-0.790484115481377|"Augh. "
"Jagged"|"Marinette"|-0.202440321445465|"What happened to the raw, impulsive artistry that made this?"
"Marinette"|"Bob"|0.169752240180969|" Yeah, about that, Mr. Roth told me–"
"Bob"|"Jagged"|0.70296847820282|"Marinette's young, Jag! She represents our target audience. She's come up with a modern concept that's exactly what you need."
"Jagged"|"Marinette"|0.0713770389556885|" Doesn't it look a lot like the cover of that YZ guy? Marinette, don't listen to Bob. Could you do another one? You know, Jagged style?"
"Marinette"|"Jagged"|0.333689093589783|"Yeah, sure!But I don't know if–"
"Jagged"|"Bob"|0.507469177246094|"You're my girl, Marinette. Remember: raw, impulsive artistry. I think we're all done here, Bob."
"Bob"|"Penny"|-0.62545770406723|" No! We are not! "
"Penny"|"Bob"|0.490990519523621|"Come with me, Marinette. Don't worry! Just do your best, okay?"
"Bob"|"XY"|-0.207946538925171|" We aren't–Aah!"
"XY"|"Jagged"|0.544218897819519|"Why am I number one? Simple. It's not about music, it's about technology. This computer is programmed to produce music and lyrics people will like. It's guaranteed success. "
"Jagged"|"Nadja"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Nadja"|"XY"|-0.0841941237449646|"You knocked Jagged Stone off the #1 spot. What do you think of him?"
"XY"|"Jagged"|-0.673103243112564|"Bleah! Jagged Stone, the hero of rock 'n' roll? Try \"Ragged Stone.\" That guy's old school, a has-been. His guitar solo is so ten minutes ago."
"Jagged"|"XY"|-0.50016862154007|"Me? Old-school? A has-been?!"
"XY"|"Jagged"|-0.297252953052521|" He's had his career, but it's over now. He'll never be number one, not while XY is here."
"Jagged"|"XY"|-0.0834023952484131|"Why, you little perfume ad!"
"XY"|"Jagged"|0.673292398452759|" My music is killer."
"Jagged"|"Nadja"|-0.320490896701813|"He's stealing my catchphrases!"
"Nadja"|"XY"|0.760677456855774|" Tonight, Mr. XY will be giving a very special one-time concert from the top of the Eiffel Tower, to celebrate his album's success, and thank his awesome fans."
"XY"|"Jagged"|0.492727875709534|" Hey Ragged, if you wanna know what today's music sounds like, come to my concert. I'll reserve you a front-row seat, old man, you know—in case your hearing's going."
"Jagged"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.750685587525368|"He can't talk about me like that! This guy's an insult to rock...and me!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.110170185565948|"I feel a disharmonious soul, an angry discord. Ideal prey for my evil akumas.Go find that Jagged Stone, and rock his world!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Jagged"|0.500059962272644|" Guitar Villain, I am Hawk Moth. I'm giving you and your vicious crocodile the power to show the whole world that you are the number one rocker! Just make sure you get me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous in return."

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.701982051134109|" Chloé speaking in the third person? Totally annoying!"

"Robustus"|"Cat Noir"|0.359264373779297|"Welcome to my trap! The only way for you to get out of here is to give me what you hold most valuable, your Miraculous!"
"Cat Noir"|"Scarabella"|-0.688152670860291|" That's one ridiculous trap. Since you brought us here without your army to defend you, you're the one who's about to be defeated!"

"Scarabella"|"All the infected Parisians"|0.313398241996765|" Hey!"
"All the infected Parisians"|"Scarabella"|0.459657073020935|" At your command, Robustus."
"Scarabella"|"Cat Noir"|-0.660276353359222|" This is just wrong! I need a better name."
"Cat Noir"|"Scarabella"|0.298814296722412|" A shorter one, maybe?"
"Scarabella"|"Cat Noir"|-0.00895786285400391|" Scarabella! That was better, wasn't it?"
"Cat Noir"|"Scarabella"|-0.324900448322296|"Now may not be the time!"
"Scarabella"|"Scarabella"|0.332395553588867|" Fine.Lucky Charm! "
"Scarabella"|"Cat Noir"|-0.566761255264282|" You're right! I'm not Ladybug!"
"Cat Noir"|"Scarabella"|0.27129054069519|" No, you're not Ladybug! You're Scarabella! And now that you have a cool name, you've gotta hang in there, cause that's what Ladybug would do! Besides, you have the best in partner in the world to help you.The funniest, incredible, Cat Noir! Meooow!"
"Scarabella"|"Robustus"|-0.736084401607513|" Okay, Robustus! You've got us trapped in here surrounded and we haven't found out where you're hiding, so looks like we lost, right?"
"Robustus"|"Scarabella"|0.486045241355896|" According to my calculations, I have a 99.98% chance of victory!"
"Scarabella"|"Cat Noir"|-0.460066437721252|" Hmm, so that 0.02% must be where Cat Noir cataclysms my Miraculous, then Shadow Moth won't get his hands on what's most valuable to him. And then, you won't actually have won! Am I correct?"
"Cat Noir"|"Shadow Moth"|0.468196988105774|" Yeah, brilliant! Cataclysm! "
"Shadow Moth"|"Robustus"|-0.693328946828842|"Watch out, Robustus! This substitute Ladybug might not be as incompetent as she seems!"
"Robustus"|"Scarabella"|-0.349054098129272|" Are you suggesting we negotiate, human superhero?"
"Scarabella"|"Robustus"|-0.594865620136261|" You got it! We're not giving up until you've released all people and objects you've captured. That way, I won't have completely goofed up my first and last mission. Maybe then, the real Ladybug won't be so mad at me."
"Robustus"|"Scarabella"|0.156561970710754|" Request granted. Now give up."
"Scarabella"|"Robustus"|-0.631141602993011|" Nope. You empty your hard drive first."
"Robustus"|"Scarabella"|-0.601328045129776|" No! You first!"
"Scarabella"|"Cat Noir"|0.339132785797119|" Fine. I'll hand myself over first, then you release everything you've captured."
"Cat Noir"|"Robustus"|-0.514673918485641|" And only then will I give myself up."
"Robustus"|"Scarabella"|-0.322418391704559|"There's a 92% chance it's a trap."
"Scarabella"|"Shadow Moth"|0.644091367721558|" To prove my good faith, I'll give you my lucky charm. That way I can't use it to win."
"Shadow Moth"|"Robustus"|0.439979434013367|"Accept the deal, Robustus!"
"Robustus"|"Cat Noir"|0.156561970710754|"Request granted. Now give up!"

"Shadow Moth"|"Cat Noir"|-0.433070659637451|"What's going on?"
"Cat Noir"|"Scarabella"|-0.662049174308777|"Did someone turn off the light?"
"Scarabella"|"Scarabella"|-0.604292541742325|" No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!Time to de-evilize!Gotcha! Bye bye, little butterfly! "

"Scarabella"|"Cat Noir"|-0.657914698123932|" Umm..."
"Cat Noir"|"Scarabella and Cat Noir"|-0.544391661882401|" Nope, but you were lucky enough to have been saved by the one and only Scarabella, in person. I don't you understand how you solved all of this, but... "

"Shadow Moth"|"Marinette"|-0.0738309025764465|" You had beginner's luck, Scarabella. But I have experience, and I will triumph in the end!"
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.163308262825012|" And that's the tower of London, where we tried to imprison Aunt Shu Yin!"
"Tom"|"Sabine"|-0.708849668502808|" But the guards didn't want her! "
"Sabine"|"Tom"|-0.363158822059631|" I heard that, Tom!"

"Sabine"|"Alya"|-0.163987636566162|" You better watch yourself..."
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.575204730033875|"You should talk to Cat Noir. It's important."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.207775712013245|" You... must've been pretty surprised to discover there was another holder! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.725937992334366|" I'm really sorry, Cat Noir. I should've told you. I mean, if I found out that you told someone about your secret identity, I'd... probably be upset, too. I'm really sorry I hurt your feelings."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.678806185722351|" You didn't hurt my feelings. You did everything right. Paris will always need a Ladybug superhero to watch over her. It's just... I realized that if one day that hero wasn't you, m'lady, since we don't know each other's identities, that means... I'd never see you again. Ever. And now, I just don't know if I can bear it."
"Ladybug"|"Tom"|-0.686024129390717|" I'll never abandon you, kitty cat. "

"André"|"Kagami"|0.733250617980957|" Which flavors for these two? Kagami and Adrien Orange and peppermint, a perfect pairing that's always a success; nothing can turn it into a mess. And for you two Adrien and Marinette blackberry and peppermint, an explosive mix that's a fact but often times it's the opposites that attract. Orange and blackberry, quite unusual it's true not the most obvious but it works for you two. So what will it be? "
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.401175379753113|" You pick. I don't really get what he's saying anyway."

"Marinette"|"Kagami"|-0.321356177330017|" I don't know. Blackberry and peppermint doesn't seem like a great pair. And what if the mint finds the blackberry lame and wants to be with the orange instead? And it's true that orange and peppermint are awesome together and well orange and blackberry just doesn't seem like they go together.Look I think your first idea was the best. The orange and peppermint ice cream for.. for my friends here."
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|0.601059198379517|" We'll go with you. "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.572615206241608|" No no, don't bother. Enjoy your ice cream.Seriously."

"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.498282074928284|"It's alright Marinette. You can tell me everything, or... nothing if you prefer. You can be yourself with me you know,just yourself."
"Adrien"|"Mylène"|-0.589656740427017|" Agent Smith, it's too dangerous! We must evacuate!"
"Mylène"|"Nino"|-0.598565518856049|" You're suggesting we run, Officer Jones? After it devoured my family, my friends, even my beloved dog, Sniffles? Never! I won't run! I no longer fear it, I'm going to face it, then I'll-Waaaaah!"
"Nino"|"Ivan"|-0.736481875181198|" Cut!"

"Mylène"|"Rose"|-0.607330620288849|" I'm... sorry. I'm gonna do better on the next take, I promise."
"Rose"|"Nino"|0.69126284122467|" Anyone want some tea?"
"Nino"|"Mylène"|-0.670854419469833|" You're playing a hero from the special forces. You're not supposed to get all freaked out!"
"Mylène"|"Ivan"|-0.37911182641983|" I know, but... that monster mask he's wearing is so... realistic and scary!"
"Ivan"|"Chloé"|-0.386186599731445|" Just big ol' me, Mylène. Nothing to be scared of!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.44676262140274|" You ask me, he doesn't even need a mask! "
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.775776892900467|" What a bratty snob!"
"Nino"|"Mylène"|-0.102825939655304|" Ivan, put the mask back on, you're playing the monster! And Mylène, we need you to stay in character!"

"Marinette"|"Ivan"|-0.15844452381134|" Mylène! Anyone gonna go after her?"
"Ivan"|"Ivan"|-0.317389607429504|" Mylenè, wait! "
"Ivan"|"Ivan"|-0.383216977119446|" Ummm... don't listen to those bozos. Easy to judge when they're not in front of the camera. You're doing awesome. Come back! I promise I'll roar more quietly."
"Ivan"|"Mylène"|0.583137392997742|"Here. It's from my favorite band, the Zombie Skull Crushers."
"Mylène"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.370335400104523|" Wow...Uh, that's, uhh... really sweet of you, Ivan. But... they're right. I can't act to save my life... Excuse me ."
"Hawk Moth"|"Nino"|-0.0250929594039917|"A film shoot... oh, yes. So many emotions. Some fake, yet others very, very real.Fly away, my evil akuma, and overpower this young, misunderstood artist..."
"Nino"|"Chloé"|0.0729612112045288|" Epic, Chloé! Just epic! What are we supposed to do now without our leading actress?"
"Chloé"|"Ivan"|-0.724803417921066|" Who needs her, anyway? She was totally lame!"
"Ivan"|"Chloé"|-0.753274261951447|" You're lame! Mylène is crying her eyes out on the bathroom thanks to you!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.796712666749954|" Me, lame?"
"Marinette"|"Max"|-0.550712317228317|" Hey, hey! Everyone chill out! You're right, Chloé is lame. But fighting isn't gonna bring Mylène back. I'm the producer, and I'm gonna do everything in my power to finish filming tonight!"
"Max"|"Marinette"|0.420674204826355|" The deadline for the Parisian Student Short Film Festival is tomorrow evening, precisely 26 hours, 15 minutes and 14, 13 seconds from now."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.627532601356506|" Thank you, Max! And we still have editing, post-sound, soundtrack..."
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.0103927850723267|" And who's gonna take Mylene's part?"
"Chloé"|"Alya"|-0.225260853767395|" Um, me of course!"
"Alya"|"Chloé"|-0.337081670761108|" You haven't even read the script!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.613985300064087|" Of course I have! The first scene anyway. I can even tell you that it ends with a kiss between Agent Smith and Officer Jones!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.373241007328033|"You wrote that?!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.699963092803955|" Hold up!I didn't write that!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.199260830879211|" Uh... I wrote it. It was just a little tweak. You know, to move the story forward."
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.720425873994827|" What! You edited my script without even telling me? That's low!"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.20445728302002|" Wait a minute! You mean our script!"
"Adrien"|"Rose"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Rose"|"Adrien"|-0.34289413690567|" Juice? "
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.539502024650574|" Thanks Rose."
"Chloé"|"Max"|-0.301089346408844|" Oh, who cares who wrote what? We've got to film this thing, right?"
"Max"|"Marinette"|-0.708457052707672|" She's right. Principal Damocles is only allowing us to use school until 6 p.m. sharp. Which leaves us 9 hours, 12 minutes and 12 seconds. 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6..."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.390539944171906|"Adrien and Chloé kissing cannot happen! No way!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.577287495136261|" It makes no sense story wise anyway. The main character's emotional journey..."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.0584789514541626|" Hold on!We can't let Mylène just leave just like that, it's... wrong! We all chose her to play the leading female role! And... we're all in this movie together! She needs our support. I'm gonna go find her and bring her back."
"Chloé"|"Mylène"|-0.751490831375122|" Always trying to save the day, aren't you, Marinette? Good luck finding the filthy hole that scaredy-cat’s hiding in!"
"Mylène"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.701204568147659|" Why are you so intimidated and scared all the time? "
"Hawk Moth"|"Mylène"|0.437248349189758|" Horrificator, I am Hawk Moth. Up until now, you have felt fear. From now on, you will cause fear. And after you show them how they make you feel, you will do something for me in return."
"Mylène"|"Marinette"|-0.387271881103516|" Yes, Hawk Moth. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.330496072769165|" Mylène? Mylène? "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.454586267471313|" Marinette! Did you find Mylène?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.586760878562927|" No..."
"Alya"|"Hawk Moth"|0.150864601135254|" Well, you better come ASAP, producer! There's some serious lip puckering about get going on!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Alix"|-0.356363534927368|" Time to use your scare tactics, Horrificator. And thrive!"
"Alix"|"Nino"|0.0662301778793335|" Horrificator, take 15."
"Nino"|"Chloé"|0.391091346740723|" Action!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.387717187404633|" I'm not scared of that Horrificator thingy, Officer Whatever-your-name-is, now kiss me!"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.736481875181198|"CUT!!!"
"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.476257801055908|" Marinette, what gives? We're in the middle of a shoot, and I'm the director, FYI. I say cut, no one else. Comprende?"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|0.402199983596802|" And I'm the producer! Mylène's supposed to be the star of this movie."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.270612120628357|" We're out of time, and from what I can see, Mylène is MIA. Let's take it from the top, people."
"Adrien"|"Alya"|0.41887640953064|" Here we go again..."
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.285201728343964|" This is beat! Agent Smith does not need a man in her life right now! Sniffles just got munched on, remember?"
"Nino"|"Chloé"|0.358725190162659|" Do you wanna finish this film or not?"
"Chloé"|"Alya"|-0.517256498336792|" Then let's just make Agent Smith a nurse instead! That'll fix everything."
"Alya"|"Chloé"|-0.595808863639832|" Um, I'm sorry. How, exactly?"
"Chloé"|"Nino"|0.664835810661316|" I don't know, but I'm sure I'd look amazing in a uniform."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.641066044569016|" Oh, come on! We're not gonna rewrite this script again!"
"Alya"|"Chloé"|-0.558904826641083|" I'm not putting my name on those credits!"
"Chloé"|"Alya"|-0.670297741889954|" Nobody cares about you anyway!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.612575769424438|" What?"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.427414774894714|" Everyone calm down! This movie's a team effort!Your nurse idea's perfect, Chloé!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.767202138900757|" Of course it's a perfect idea. Because it's mine!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.660881191492081|" But, Chloé, you don't have a uniform."
"Chloé"|"Alya"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.448675990104675|" Right! Which is why that idea wasn't believable in the first place."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.499548316001892|" I think you and your assistant should go down to the nurse's office and try out some uniforms."
"Chloé"|"Nino"|0.568843603134155|" Hmm. Kim, Max, come with me! You've just been promoted to wardrobe and bodyguard. "
"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.564632803201675|" Nice going, Miss Producer! Now we have no lead again!"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.55598446726799|" Yeah, but now we've just gotten rid of Chloé!"
"Nino"|"Marinette"|0.182304739952087|" And now what?"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|0.509701371192932|" We go find Mylène! She's here somewhere!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.236406445503235|" I told you. Tick tock, there's no time, we need a lead now!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.150333285331726|" Marinette can do it!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.403166174888611|" What?! No! I can't act. I'm the producer. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.057180643081665|"But you wanna kiss Adrien, don't you?"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.538031995296478|"Yes, but not like this."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.346343278884888|" A nurse's uniform. How brilliant am I! Even that dimwit, Marinette, liked the idea."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.360212922096252|" I'm only doing this as a favor, you know? As soon as Mylène comes back, she'll have her old role back."
"Alya"|"Chloé"|0.19470226764679|" 'Course she will, chill out, and just think. After tonight, you'll finally have kissed Adrien..."
"Chloé"|"Kim"|-0.62706595659256|" Hey, wait a minute! Marinette never likes my ideas. I think you've all been duped! You guys take care of the nurse uniform thing, just in case. "
"Kim"|"Max"|-0.290038287639618|" Did you hear something?"
"Max"|"Marinette"|-0.587476491928101|" No. What?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.309666156768799|" Totally unbelievable..."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.283884286880493|" What's that?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.213029026985168|" Uh, I said... uh, it's... got to be believable!"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.00376635789871216|" Don't worry, you'll do fine."
"Nino"|"Alix"|0.543021440505981|" Ready to roll? Camera!"
"Alix"|"Nino"|-0.139006316661835|" Horrificator, take 16..."
"Nino"|"Marinette"|0.391091346740723|" Action!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.658753126859665|" I'm not scared of that monster, officer Jones!"
"Chloé"|"Nino"|-0.428699493408203|"CUT!!! I knew it!"
"Nino"|"Chloé"|-0.666422694921494|" What did I say about other people saying cut?!"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|-0.594254314899445|" Well played, Marinette! All that speech about working together, then you stab me right in the back! Well, your stupid little movie won't make it into the festival if I'm not in it, because my daddy is one of the judges!"
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|-0.0383767485618591|" Did you guys hear that?"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.648303419351578|" If this is another one of your silly ploys to get me out of the way, you can forget it! Besides, I—"
"Marinette"|"Rose"|0.649229884147644|" I definitely heard that. We better scope this out!"
"Rose"|"Adrien"|0.687787771224976|" A fruity snack for the road?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.654404044151306|" Hey! Anybody here? Kim! Max! Where are you guys!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.124781847000122|" I saw the same pink goo...The bathroom!"
"Adrien"|"Nathaniel"|-0.343204617500305|"That's Kim's!"
"Nathaniel"|"Alya"|-0.71854442358017|"They vanished!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.688420027494431|" Or they're playing a sick joke on us."
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.473625183105469|" We should go to principal Damocles' office and tell him what's going on! Nino, come on! Stop filming!"
"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.420413613319397|" Not a chance! This is just getting good!"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|0.0661839246749878|"Looks like it's time to bring in the alter ego."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.461147546768188|" Yo, Adrien! Where are you going?"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.5904221534729|" I left Officer Jones' jacket back there! Should probably wear it in all the scenes."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.0911628007888794|" Time to transform, Plagg."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.0587928295135498|" What are you doing?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.609053879976273|"So, they'll think I've disappeared too."
"Plagg"|" Adrien"|-0.380263924598694|" And you say I stink of Camembert!"
" Adrien"|"Alya"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Alya"|"Rose"|0.434955835342407|" Mr. Damocles? Sir? "
"Rose"|"Marinette"|-0.686010211706161|" Even Principal Damocles is nowhere to be found!"
"Marinette"|" Marinette"|0.164726614952087|" Time to transform."
" Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.443314373493195|" Tikki, spots on! Ha!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.529231786727905|" Anyone seen Agent Smith? I mean, Marinette."
"Alya"|"Chloé"|-0.454673230648041|" Oh, no! This is Marinette's phone!"
"Chloé"|"Juleka"|-0.109835267066956|"Quick, check the windows!"
"Juleka"|"Chloé"|-0.489830911159515|" Crazy!"
"Chloé"|"Nino"|-0.47348016500473|"We're trapped! I'm going to call Daddy! "
"Nino"|"Ivan"|-0.755730792880058|" Dudes, you know cellphones never work in horror movies."
"Ivan"|"Nathaniel"|-0.601707249879837|" No bars."
"Nathaniel"|"Nino"|-0.523512184619904|" No coverage!"
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|0.294441938400269|" Told you so! Boo-yah!"
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|-0.380061388015747|"Is everything okay?"
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.533741354942322|" Ladybug in my movie? This is legit!"
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.271391034126282|" And on my Ladyblog!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.459661662578583|" We've got to calmly evacuate the building, okay everyone? "
"Cat Noir"|"Nino"|-0.0779575109481812|" Uh-uh, easier said than done, Ladybug!"
"Nino"|"Cat Noir"|0.486087679862976|" Double legit!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.502420693635941|" I tried to cut through the goo, but it's no good. Totally indestructible. So, looks like we're trapped inside the school for now. Just stay put and try to relax, guys.Shall we take a stroll, my lady?We both know that Hawk Moth's taken another innocent victim somewhere in school."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.270042598247528|" And there's only one way to get rid of this pink goo and get everyone outta here. Capture that victim's akuma."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.548706650733948|" Exactly. I love it when you read my mind..."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.45616090297699|" Ugh... And we better find this thing first, and its prisoners."
"Cat Noir"|"Nino"|-0.129820764064789|" Wow! You did it again! "
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|-0.153693914413452|" Don't mind me, finding the missing peeps and solving this crazy mystery with Cat Noir and Ladybug... This movie's gonna be so swank!"

"Hawk Moth"|"Chloé"|0.443910121917725|" Absorb their fear, Horrificator... feed on it! It will give you strength. And soon enough, you will be giving me strength too! "
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.653451651334763|" We're way better off on our own than sticking with the others. Why would we stay with the group when we could just hide out on our own!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.175588607788086|" There!"
"Cat Noir"|"Nino"|0.59210205078125|" Anyone recognize this shoe?"
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|-0.3395956158638|" That's Adrien's shoe!"
"Ladybug"|"Nathaniel"|-0.633697330951691|" That's weird! There's no pink slime here."
"Nathaniel"|"Ladybug"|-0.0506997108459473|"Yes, there is."

"Cat Noir"|"Nathaniel"|-0.723436325788498|" I don't see anything. Just miles of slime."

"Ladybug"|"Rose"|-0.422096073627472|" Fear! It's fear that gives it its strength!"
"Rose"|"Ladybug"|-0.520384043455124|" Oh no! It's taking Nate and Alix!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.067628800868988|" The more scared people are of it, the more powerful it gets! By defeating fear, we defeat it!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.281937181949615|" Okay, but first we gotta get out of this sticky situation quickly before it dries. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.651160359382629|" Did you see how it just left Ivan alone?"

"Tomoe"|"Voice message"|0.530164003372192|" Remember the story of the female samurai warrior, Tomoe Gozen? In a time when women warriors were so few and rarely accepted, do you think she gave up?

"Tomoe"|"Tatsu"|-0.406074047088623|" Gabriel Agreste has many admirable qualities, but this only goes to prove that even he is flawed by being too permissive with his son. In some ways, he is more blind than I am.Tatsu, to the Grand Palais."

"Aurore"|"Tomoe"|0.601669788360596|" Thank you so much for your participation, Adrien. Now all we need to do is wait for the first new couple of friends. "

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.304926633834839|" Very clever, Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.353973984718323|" Now let's keep our eyes peeled. Hopefully my new friend is here somewhere.Oh no!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.305749356746674|" What is it? A supervillain?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.678587704896927|" Worse, Tikki. Kagami? My new friend? No way! She's brilliant, strong, cute."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.14186304807663|" And?"
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|-0.347829222679138|" And she's got a huge crush on Adrien! They're already fencing partners, their parents are friends, so if we win, she gets all the credit and she'll wind up being his girlfriend for sure! There's no way I'm doing this with her. Nope. Nu-uh. Not doin' it! Uh-uh!"
"Kagami"|"Tikki"|-0.490740299224854|"She's so weird. Okay, fate has placed her in my path. I have to succeed. If I fail with Adrien's quirky friend, I'll never pull it off."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.731216073036194|" Marinette, this isn't fair to Kagami. If you won't be her friend, she won't be able to play."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.177827119827271|" Yeah, right. She's so smart, I'm sure she'd figure a way around it. Probably even do it twice as fast by herself. In fact, I bet I'd just slow her down if I went.Of course! You're right, Tikki! If I stick with her, I can make us lose. And then Adrien would never see Kagami win and they'll never fall in love."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.663048774003983|" Uh, come to think of it, perhaps it would be better for you not to go."
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.585554718971252|" Hide, Tikki! The game is on!Kagami! Woah! This must be fate! I mean, what were the odds of you and I being paired up? One in ten million at least. Right? So awesome! "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.660581946372986|" You didn't look too happy about being my secret friend, though. I saw you turn around and walk away just now."
"Marinette"|"Voice message"|-0.258287310600281|"I-I actually thought I'd, um, gotten the place wrong. I totally hadn't seen you yet. No way! Really, I'm super excited to play the game with you. "
"Voice message"|"Marinette"|0.469439744949341|" Congratulations! You've just located your game partner. And who knows? Maybe even a new friend for life. You've just received the second riddle!"
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.522858738899231|" To get closer to your goal, you must explore further and deeper. I know! We have to take the train at Gare du Nord station, leave Paris, and head straight to England."
"Kagami"|"Alya"|-0.278403043746948|" No. Explore further and deeper means we have to go further down the banks of the Seine, which is deeper than this canal. We'll probably have to fish for our new clue. Come on, Marinette. Let's hurry up and win."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.388529658317566|"Hey girl! I sure hope your partner's as cool as mine; meet Wayhem! You'd better hurry up if you wanna get to Adrien before we do, 'cause we've already solved our first riddle!"
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.495631456375122|"I'm with Kagami, can you believe this? Go for the win, 'cause there's no way I'm gonna let us find Adrien as long as I'm with her. "
"Kagami"|"Kagami"|0.269659519195557|" Look, we were right. We have to fish up the next clue using this rod and magnet. Here.Now fish."
"Kagami"|"Kagami"|-0.704489409923553|" Probably not the clue. "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|0.618093848228455|" Do you prefer to be called by your whole name, or a nickname? "
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.136443734169006|" Uh– by… my… whole name…? "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|0.675515651702881|" Thank you, Marinette. Uh– Your hair is… very shiny. "
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.472978830337524|"Ehm… thank you…?Your hair is not… too bad, either…"
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|0.429235696792603|"What is your blood type? "
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|-0.242596328258514|" My blood type? I don't… know… Are you messing with me?"
"Kagami"|"Kagami"|-0.353186368942261|" No, not at all. Everyone in Japan knows their blood type. It tells you who you are. Mine is O, which means I'm independent, optimistic, strong-willed and intuitive."
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|0.696426033973694|" What's your favourite season? "
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.801466822624207|" Summer, 'cause it's nice and hot. Or spring,'cause that's when nature awakens. Or maybe the fall; the colours are so gorgeous that time of the year. But then again; winter inspires me so much."
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.741006374359131|" You're indecisive, scatterbrained, irresponsible. You have a split personality: typical AB.Let's say you found out about some special chocolate ice cream; you really want to try it, but someone else gets there first. Do you, A, steal it from them? B, get another type of chocolate ice cream, even if it's not as good? Or, C, never eat chocolate ice cream ever again? "
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|-0.488937020301819|" Uh– I guess I'd try another flavor?"
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|0.629172325134277|" Hmm…Would you like to get some orange juice with me?"
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.0320320129394531|" Sure… It'd be a lot more fun than this boring treasure hunt."
"Kagami"|"Kagami"|0.518858671188354|"The clue. You've done a great job fishing.Congratulations, Marinette. First we win, then we get orange juice to celebrate."

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.472710490226746|"She placed her trust in you when she gave you her phone."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.486404180526733|" But she kept looking at it the whole time. Don't you wanna know why? For all we know she could've been chatting with Adrien, texting him, who knows what else?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.585668355226517|" Marinette, no!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.669023901224136|"Huh–? Zero messages except the ones from the contest.And there's only one number in her list of contacts:her mom's . She doesn't even have Adrien's number?What's this app? Oh shoot! So this is what Kagami was looking at the whole time."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.598516225814819|" Learning tips for making friends."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.0511474609375|" That explains everything. Her strange behavior, her weird questions."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.265823006629944|" Kagami was just trying to be your friend."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.675164729356766|" I feel so bad. Oh no! She's got my phone. If she sneaks a peak, she'll see the messages Alya and I were sending each other."

"Marinette"|"Tomoe"|0.64421272277832|" Kagami! I'm a friend of Kagami's, I'm right here with her. I'll put her on the phone."
"Tomoe"|"Marinette"|-0.458888947963715|" Kagami doesn't have any friends. Why do you have her phone?"
"Marinette"|"Tomoe"|0.694319009780884|"Oh I can assure you, ma'am, I am a friend of Kagami's. We've been teamed up together for a game."

"Ladybug"|"Plagg"|-0.574875563383102|" What's gotten into him? I didn't do anything."
"Plagg"|"Ladybug"|-0.803012371063232|" Didn't do anything? Well yeah, you did! You've been neglecting a very classy piece of camemebert on your plate for too long! And as a result it got runny, and moldy!"
"Ladybug"|"Plagg"|-0.680614590644836|" What? Cat Noir never gave me any camembert."
"Plagg"|"Ladybug"|-0.510183900594711|" Of course not, Cat Noir is the camembert! For a while now, you've been neglecting this camembert— I mean Cat Noir, and going on adventures with the all other cheeses!"
"Ladybug"|"Plagg"|-0.398919403553009|" But he should be happy about it, it gives him more time off."
"Plagg"|"Ladybug"|-0.690088391304016|" Cat Noir doesn't wanna have time off, Ladybug! He is in love with you! And your persistent calling on other heroes has broken his heart."
"Ladybug"|"Plagg"|-0.496107637882233|" I'm really sorry if Cat Noir is hurt, but I'm doing my best as a guardian."
"Plagg"|"Ladybug"|-0.384963631629944|"I know. Just... give me the Miraculous. I'll give it back to him, cheer him up, we'll chow down on some grilled mimolette sandwiches and everything will go back to normal."
"Ladybug"|"Plagg"|-0.7240269780159|" It's useless. The problem is that Cat Noir is in love with me. And since I can't do anything about that, I'll keep on breaking his heart over and over again. Maybe Cat Noir is right. We should split."
"Plagg"|"Ladybug"|0.587533712387085|" Woaaah! Not so fast! May I remind you that Cat Noir's a very competent superhero and that your powers complement each other?"
"Ladybug"|"Plagg"|-0.220430314540863|" I know I can't do it without a Cat Noir... So I'll just have to choose another one, who won't be in love with me!"
"Plagg"|"Ladybug"|-0.168139278888702|" Another Cat Noir? What do you mean another Cat Noir?"
"Ladybug"|"Plagg"|0.681172013282776|" I'm going to choose a new Cat Noir myself. One who won't be in love with me. And since I'll know who he is, I can call on him whenever I need him. "
"Plagg"|"Ladybug"|0.477542042732239|" Woah woah woah! You mean you'll know who he is? You'll know his secret identity?"
"Ladybug"|"Plagg"|0.316340923309326|" You're right! I can't do that! If I know who Cat Noir is and Shadow Moth akumatizes me, he'll know where to find Cat Noir and he'll capture both our Miraculous! He'll merge them together and make his wish come true, and then the whole world will turn into whatever he wants!"
"Plagg"|"Ladybug"|-0.554218322038651|" See? You can't do that, so come on, give me back the Miraculous. I'll just tell him to erase you from his heart, and everything will be fine."
"Ladybug"|"Plagg"|0.611620187759399|" You really think he's capable of that?"
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|0.268982529640198|" I sure hope so."
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|0.387693643569946|" I've got it!I meet him anonymously and make sure he's already got a girlfriend and that for real he thinks Ladybug is cool and all, but just like a friend. Then, I mail him the Miraculous and— ah, shoot! I need his address to mail him the Miraculous and his name too!Curse you Cat Noir! This is all your fault!Why do you have to be in love with me, huh? What am I supposed to do now?"
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|-0.168462038040161|"And yet she loves my holder."
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|0.687712550163269|"And he loves Ladybug."
"Plagg"|"Nathalie"|-0.520987689495087|" Sugarcube! I know how to fix this and get them back together! But I'm gonna need your help."
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|-0.526743590831757|"Adrien, you're late for breakfa—Adrien? Are you okay?"
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.598165273666382|" I'm fine, Nathalie. I just don't feel like going to school. "
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.461329579353333|" When is his next photoshoot?"
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.341452598571777|" In three days."
"Gabriel"|"Tikki"|-0.710025131702423|" He will feel better by then. He's an Agreste."
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|-0.50252702832222|" But I can't lie to Marinette!"
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.677226543426514|" Who said anything about lying? I'm just asking you to smile and nod!My dear guardian, you cannot continue keeping both the Miraculous of destruction and creation under the same roof. If Shadow Moth ever found that out and came here..."
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.374338805675507|" I know that, but I can't figure out how to recruit a new Cat Noir."
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.443943023681641|" Because you can't know his identity, right?"
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.493639349937439|" Well, dry your eyes! We've found the solution! Tikki's the one who reminded me of it actually."
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.158719837665558|" It's true that my owner is fantastic, but there is one other boy. Master Fu hesitated between the two of them when he was choosing Cat Noir, and Tikki and I liked him even better.He'd make a perfect Cat Noir! And more importantly, he's not in love with you, and I mean not at all!"
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|0.0139645338058472|" How can you be sure of that?"
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|0.485579013824463|" Because... it's a kwami power!And, since I can go and present the Miraculous to him myself, you'll never know who he is! That way, you'll have a new Cat Noir, who's not in love with you at all and everything will be perfect!"
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.451423227787018|"But... isn't it kind of risky to leave you on your own outside without a holder with your own Miraculous? What if Shadow Moth would capture you?"
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.288359344005585|" Shadow Moth doesn't even know that Cat Noir has given his Miraculous back!"
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|0.325533270835876|" We have to agree that this new Cat Noir would be up to the challenge, right? We're spending time together, so I have to be able to get along with him. He'll have to be nice, generous—"
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|0.622700214385986|" Hang on, I'm talking about a top shelf Cat Noir here. Brave but calm, and rational too! As strong as he is intelligent, thoughtful, and trustworthy. I promise you, take the time to get to know him and you'll see he's the Cat Noir of your dreams!"
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.349867522716522|"Are you trying to pull one over on me Plagg?"
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|0.383018732070923|" Oh, Sugarcube, tell her! She can trust me, can't she?"
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|0.371974587440491|" Okay then."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.561557650566101|"I promise you won't regret it!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.568051218986511|" Plagg?If you're here for your cheese it's over there."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.542392253875732|" Not at all! I've got a great plan to get us back to-No! My favorite old honey tomme cheese! Mushed into fresh goat cheese... well, we'll deal with that later. I'm just gonna blame this on your recent psychological state. Listen, I have Ladybug believing that I found a perfect new holder for Cat Noir. And this new holder is you!Come on! What do you say to your good old kwami buddy who you thought you'd never see again?Hey, you! Enough with the talking gloomy act! You and me, just like before!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.623216062784195|" I can't be just like before, Plagg. If I become Cat Noir again, Ladybug will just end up rejecting me, over and over."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.141055881977081|" I get it. It's hard to be thrown out with the old cheese rinds. But I'm not talking about being the Cat Noir you used to be!You're gonna be the new Cat Noir! Wait until you see how brilliant this is! After all the time I've spent with Ladybug, I know exactly what she's looking for! So you and I are gonna whip up a tailor-made Cat Noir! So perfect that believe me, she'll never forget to call on you for help again!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.148227334022522|"But as soon as I transform into Cat Noir, she'll know it's me."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.6702980697155|"Nope! Because when your personality changes, your costume changes too! Up until now, whenever you transform into Cat Noir, you didn't think about it, it was natural. And what came out was this Cat Noir.Not at all what Ladybug wants! But if you focus hard, you can be a completely different Cat Noir!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.0955424308776855|" You really think so?"
"Plagg"|"Plagg"|0.381316781044006|" Of course! Concentrate."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.296115279197693|" Alright, you're like a little ball of fresh curd, that doesn't know yet, that it can be something more than a camembert! But if you think hard about what you're doing, if you age your crust and choose the right fermentation, you can be any cheese you want."
"Adrien"|"Cat Noir"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out! "
"Cat Noir"|"Plagg"|-0.454914927482605|"Claws in."
"Plagg"|"Plagg"|0.514319777488708|" Okay... we've got some work to do."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.601186364889145|"Serious Cat? A little too direct. Silky Kitten? Hmmm.. too cutzy. Night Whiskers?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.37569797039032|" That's pretty paw-sitive, isn't it?"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.24211984872818|"What did we say about cat puns?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.632742494344711|"No more cat puns under any circumstances."
"Plagg"|"Plagg"|0.261845231056213|" You know how to be serious, like when you're with your father and Nathalie. Just be like that!Mm-hmm. Perfect. And I guarantee that Ladybug will not be able to do it without you."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.666854739189148|" Kitty Kitty.. Cat of the Night... Citizen Cat... Obscure Kitty... Super Cat... Black Kitty... Feline Kitty... Cat Man... Adrien, I think we finally got it."
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.525904804468155|"This time, no more improvisations. The rules will be clear from the start. I'll be firm with him right away."
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|0.646936416625977|"Good evening, Ladybug. I'm Cat Walker."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|0.746927380561829|" Purr-fectly delighted!"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|0.0495550632476807|"Likewise."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.711829125881195|" You.. don't burst out laughing, don't you think that's funny?"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|0.665625810623169|" I find the play on words nicely done. Plagg told me you were exceptional and he is good as his word. If you'd like, next time, I will laugh."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.318587422370911|"Oh, no, don't, I- You don't have to force yourself to laugh.So tell me, Cat Walker, how old are you? Do you have brothers and sisters? Any hobbies in particular?"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.518447875976562|" Answering your questions would risk revealing my secret identity."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|0.271886706352234|" Wow, you really are perfect. Um- I mean- your answer was perfect. Let's see how well you think on your feet. Say, a supervillain shows up and you know nothing about them. What would be your first reaction? A, you rush towards them and cataclysm them, B, you-"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|0.616413593292236|"First I get to a safe place to observe them. And that's what you should do too, Ladybug."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.645184546709061|" You know, I guess there's no more time for chit-chat. Let's get to work right now!No, Cat Noir, stop! This is ridiculous!"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.365737557411194|" You think that's Cat Noir?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.398374140262604|" Of course it's Cat Noir! He must've been akumatized because he regrets having given up his Miraculous!"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.527719795703888|"What if it's not Cat Noir?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|0.634481072425842|" Leave this to me, Cat Walker. I know him really well. "
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.674416363239288|" Ladybug!"
"Ladybug"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.722201853990555|" I'm so sorry, Cat Noir! I didn't realize how broken-hearted you were over this!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Shadow Moth"|0.507005214691162|" Cat Noir? What is she talking about? Kuro Neko, be a nice kitty cat. Get me Ladybug's Miraculous..."
"Shadow Moth"|"Cat Walker"|0.0337661504745483|"...and you'll be free to play forever."
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.351744771003723|" If that was Cat Noir, don't you think he'd talk to you?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.424592137336731|" It's true, he usually does talk a lot more. He must be really upset that I found someone to take his place!"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.373949229717255|" With that slot on his back, he looks more like a piggy bank, don't you think?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|0.167365193367004|" You'll see once we deakumatize him.Cataclysm his bell, I'm sure that's where the akuma is!"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.582700908184052|" Hang on!Ladybug, what if that's a sentimonster? If I use my power on him, he'll lose control and become more dangerous!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.133678913116455|"You're right! Wow, Plagg really took his job as a coach seriously!But trust me, I know Cat Noir-Hey, what are you doing?!"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|0.746913909912109|" Kitty, kitty! Meow, meow, kitty!This should do. Meow, meow, meow!That's right, come here.Mmm, this smells good!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.310921311378479|" What's he doing?"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.461271703243256|" Cats sometimes eat grass, it helps them spit out their hairballs."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.387857019901276|" Cat Noir loves acting like a clown, but he wouldn't go so far as to eat real grass."
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.486258268356323|"What I mean is you're right to doubt, and I agree with you. Until we know for sure whether we're dealing with a sentimonster, someone who's been akumatized, we shouldn't make any brash decisions.Let's find out more."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.217335283756256|"I'm only saying this because you asked me to think on my feet, you know? But you're the Guardian and whatever your plan is, I'll follow it."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.616485923528671|"You were right from the start, of course that's not Cat Noir!"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|0.132079243659973|" It's completely understandable why you think that."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.680911183357239|" Yeah, but hello? I just confused my former partner with a giant piggy bank! I didn't see he was hurt and couldn't stop him from leaving either. I must be the worst Guardian ever!"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.743864297866821|" There's nothing wrong with you. Maybe the boy who was Cat Noir was more sensitive than it seemed. But his feelings for you shouldn't force you to pay more attention to him than to others. You take care of everybody equally, Ladybug.Now I want to take care of you."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.292004585266113|" Uh.. thanks."
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|0.145577073097229|" Shall we? "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.168945133686066|"Thanks for being so charming with me- oh, uh, what I meant was-"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|0.658301115036011|" Lucky Charm?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.612575769424438|" What?"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|0.0295311212539673|" You meant that you need your yo-yo to call up your Lucky Charm, right?"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.402190089225769|" Yes, right! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.450549960136414|" A parachute? "
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.244829058647156|" Are you okay?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.189201414585114|"Uh.. yes, but I'm gonna need you. Use the parachute to blind the cat, and I'll... snatch his bell with my yo-yo."
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.0286101698875427|" Watch out!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.660787224769592|"Let's not panic, I must've made a mistake. Let's try something else.Uh... okay, I think.. I know what to do. At least I hope so..."
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|0.580436825752258|" Here, kitty, kitty! Meow!Meow! Kitty, kitty, kitty!That's when I use my superpower, right?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.294127404689789|" Right! Make sure not to touch anything other than the bell!"
"Cat Walker"|"Rythm"|-0.726003736257553|" Cataclysm!"
"Rythm"|"Ladybug"|-0.370026886463165|"Shadow Moth, my cat is broken! You promised me a kitty who listens to me! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.578230291604996|" You were right, it is a sentimonster! And there's a child inside of it, we gotta get her out!"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.00153142213821411|" I'll go and recharge my Cataclysm. I might be able to break the object controlling it."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.750348910689354|" He's so... perfect.And that's... the problem."
"Cat Walker"|"Plagg"|-0.454914927482605|" Claws in. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.720763444900513|" So, how's this new camembert recipe taste?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.767655819654465|" I don't know, Plagg, things just aren't working as they were before. It's not the same."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.590585350990295|" That's expected, Adrien, you're not the same as before!"
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.651455760002136|"Plagg, claws out."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.649385333061218|"I'm sorry, Cat Walker, I tried every way I could to include you in the plan but.. the lucky charm doesn't work with you."
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|0.429710149765015|"That's what I figured out too."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.732388198375702|" You're not mad? You don't feel sad or... left out?"
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.270990967750549|"No. The mission comes first. I'm not making another move.Good luck, Ladybug. "
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.584057986736298|" He really is too... perfect.Yoohoo! Hello, kitty, kitty! "
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.039553165435791|"Excuse me! I need you to put all the freshly mown grass that you can into here, please!"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.482665657997131|" Come on, you big kitty! It's time to spit up that hairball!"
"Ladybug"|"Rythm"|0.279250621795654|"Could you please give me your piggy bank?"
"Rythm"|"Ladybug"|-0.541812688112259|"No way! All the money that I saved up to buy kitty toys for my cat is in here!"
"Ladybug"|"Rythm"|-0.163660764694214|"Uh... him?"
"Rythm"|"Ladybug"|-0.676848292350769|"No, my cat's ran away. So Shadow Moth promised he'd give me the biggest kitty in the world to replace him but this cat is mean.. and he doesn't listen. I want my kitty cat! "
"Ladybug"|"Rythm"|-0.546063423156738|"You know what? I lost my kitty cat too. And I miss him a lot. We just need to break your piggy bank long enough for the big cat to stop being naughty, and then my magic ladybugs will fix it. And that way, when you find your cat, you can still buy him the best toys in the world."
"Rythm"|"Ladybug"|0.48602294921875|" Okay."
"Ladybug"|" Superpower sequence Ladybug"|-0.48163366317749|" Time to de-evilize!Gotcha! Bye-bye, little feather."
" Superpower sequence Ladybug"|"Rytym"|0.223827004432678|" Miraculous Ladybug! "
"Rytym"|"Ladybug and Cat Walker"|0.233479499816895|"My kitten! "
"Ladybug and Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.0031467080116272|" You were perfect. No, you were perfect. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|-0.61244985461235|" But, Cat Noir..."
"Cat Walker"|"Ladybug"|-0.738560348749161|" ...is not me. Plagg will give you the ring back."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Walker"|0.3570796251297|" And.. he'll send it back to its previous owner."
"Cat Walker"|"Cat Walker"|0.77840268611908|"Nice to have met you, Ladybug. Cat Noir... is a very lucky guy."
"Cat Walker"|"Adrien"|-0.454914927482605|" Claws in."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.694426149129868|"Your great plan didn't really work out, Plagg."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.0135253667831421|" Are you kidding? It worked better than if it actually worked!So long, serious cat, we're finally gonna be super cool cat again!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.530253231525421|" But what if I can't do it? Become the old Cat Noir again?"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.586708962917328|" Don't worry about that! Just be yourself and he'll be back in two shakes of a cat's tail!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.00797295570373535|"But, does that mean Cat Noir is really who I am? Deep down inside?"
"Plagg"|"Cat Noir"|-0.245296239852905|"You're not Cat Noir, but you're not Adrien either. You're both. You're the perfect son who's extremely successful in everything he does. But you're also Cat Noir, who just wants to enjoy life and have fun. One can't exist without the other. And I sure am glad to have both of you back!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.296834528446198|"I've been a really temperamental kitty, m'lady. I didn't realize how much trouble I'd make for you by giving back my Miraculous."
"Ladybug"|"Nadja"|-0.569622427225113|"Just because I don't need you all the time doesn't mean that I don't need you at all, Cat Noir. No one could ever replace you."
"Ms. Bustier"|"Tikki"|-0.102290987968445|" In 1670, Molière was commissioned by King Louis the 14th, nicknamed the Sun King, to write a play that was meant to ridicule a certain ambassador-"
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|-0.682755887508392|" Plagg, you promised me you wouldn't go back there!"
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|-0.30677592754364|" Sorry, Sugarcube, but I can't resist such irresistible beauty! Here it sits everyday beckoning me with its gooey lusciousness. And every time I eat it, it just pops right back up the very next day! "
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|-0.630864888429642|" Don't you think it's strange that this gross, stinky thing just reappears in the same spot day after day?"
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|0.5194091796875|" That's precisely why I call it the magic cheese!"
"Tikki"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.544137626886368|" Yargh!"
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Tikki"|-0.25393545627594|" Ah, I've got you at last, strange creatures."
"Tikki"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.662637561559677|" This is exactly why you should always listen to me! Let's get out of here!"
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Plagg"|-0.539199233055115|"Ugh! And they speak too?!"
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|-0.521543145179749|"I can't!It's impossible to abandon such a creamy, cozy Reblochon!"
"Tikki"|"Class"|-0.510982394218445|"Plagg!"
"Class"|"Ms. Bustier"|-0.608638793230057|" Huh? Hey? What is going on?"
"Ms. Bustier"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|0.472539901733398|"Stay focused on Molière and his plays."
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Tikki"|-0.41489964723587|"Ugh, go ahead and run away. I have proof of my great scientific discovery! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.710678517818451|" Hmm. You don't want me reading your little secrets, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.642798662185669|" (places her diary in its designated box as seen in \"Alya don't know me as well as you do. I'm so happy to have you, Tikki. You're the only being I can really be myself with, without ever having to lie."

"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.61213755607605|" Good night, Tikki."
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|0.16251266002655|" Good night, Marinette.Plagg, we must tell our owners or Master Fu the truth about what happened today."
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|-0.676732927560806|" Chill out, Sugarcube. Don't forget that nobody can capture or record us."
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|-0.6441550552845|" I know that, but we were actually seen by a human. And at school, too! That could jeopardize our owners' secret identities."
"Plagg"|"Alya"|-0.600263833999634|" Aaw, okay, I promise you I won't eat any more magic cheese ever again and really what's the worst that could happen anyway."
"Alya"|"Kim"|-0.170858561992645|" Mr. Damocles, can you confirm rumors that Ms. Mendeleiev isn't here today, because she'll be appearing on the Alternative Truth TV show?"
"Kim"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.712305665016174|" Where everything isn't always true,but nothing's really false! "
"Mr. Damocles"|"Juleka, Mylène, Nino, Ivan, and Kim"|0.714846253395081|"It is indeed quite possible that Ms. Mendeleiv has made a scientific discovery of utmost importance."
"Juleka, Mylène, Nino, Ivan, and Kim"|"Plagg"|0.429291486740112|" Can we watch the show, please,dude ?"
"Plagg"|"Alix"|-0.515446186065674|"Huh…?"
"Alix"|"Alec"|-0.417288661003113|"Ugh, my brother is one of the guests, too..."
"Alec"|"Kim"|-0.0497865080833435|" And we're back for the next segment of Alternative Truthwhere everything isn't always true , but nothing's really false! Let's welcome our last guest today: Ms. Mendeleiev, a science teacher at Françoise Dupont High School."

"Mr. Damocles"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.190972864627838|" Kim, sit down, please."
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Alec"|0.656959891319275|" Hello, thank you for having me."
"Alec"|"Kim"|-0.431160151958466|"You're going to describe an innovative scientific theory to our panel of experts who will then decide if it's true or false."
"Kim"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.668777197599411|" True or false!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Alec"|-0.076998770236969|" Sit!"
"Alec"|"Mr. Banana"|0.447527050971985|" So, Ms. Mendeleiev, you already know our jury, its members are, as always: the famous singer XY and the one and only Mr. Banana!"
"Mr. Banana"|"Alec"|0.665988922119141|"Stay peachy!"
"Alec"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|0.678514361381531|" And the incredible Manon Chamack, daughter of our favorite news reporter Nadja Chamack. Over to you, Ms. Mendeleiev."
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Chloé"|0.507125973701477|" What are you about to witness is proof of the existence of interdimensional creatures with incredible powers who can move through matter and seem to be attracted to aged cheese.I discovered the first of these creatures soon after school began in September,I started observing it closely. Then, I discovered a second one. I have proof, watch closely:you can't see the creatures themselves because they are not filmable- but look right there.Given that I was unable to capture these creatures on video, I've made sketches of them to give you an idea of what they look like."
"Chloé"|"Max"|-0.64627268910408|" What's that even supposed to be?"
"Max"|"Alec"|-0.552174419164658|" I seriously doubt this show was remotely scientific whatsoever."
"Alec"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.728893756866455|" Ms. Mendeleiev,are you actually serious about chasing cheese-eating ghosts?"
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Marinette"|0.364567995071411|" I'm always serious."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.690618932247162|" I thought we didn't keep secrets from one another...!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.770748496055603|" I didn't want to bother you with Kwami nonsense. Besides, I thought the problem had been resolved, Plagg promised he wouldn't eat any of that magic cheese anymore."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.0231446027755737|" Wait a sec! If Plagg was there too, that means he was here in this school! Which means Cat Noir is a student at Françoise Dupont, just like me?! And if I just figured this out, then that means that Cat Noir probably just figured out that I figured out that he figured it out!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.589540839195251|" Uh, no, not at all! You know, Plagg would travel for miles just to sink his teeth into good cheese. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.729123443365097|"You see the problem now is that I'm always going to wonder whether you're lying or not. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.712900578975677|" I'm so sorry, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Alec"|-0.562995404005051|" It's okay. I know you're trying to protect me. If I figure out who he is, I'll have to give up my Miraculous and Ladybug. So I won't try, and I hope he doesn't either."

"Mr. Banana"|"Alec"|-0.139239192008972|"No, but stay peachy! "
"Alec"|"Mr. Banana"|-0.584227472543716|" But you do have two votes, which means that you, too, have won, Vincent!Last but not least, Ms. Mendeleiev has hypothesized that there are interdimentional creatures who like to eat cheese.I'm very sorry, Ms. Mendeleiev, but your fake video footage failed to convince our panel of experts."
"Mr. Banana"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|0.665988922119141|"Stay peachy! "
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Alec"|0.052947998046875|" It wasn't fake, I swear! This is an authentic, major scientific discovery! "

"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.737002372741699|" Puh-lease, it's impossible to capture a kwami. May I remind you that we can move through matter and we can't be filmed or photographed? You're as much of a party pooper as Sugarcube."

"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.466947257518768|" Uh Tikki, Ladybug's kwami. "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.410293817520142|" Wait a second. If Tikki was there, too, then that means she was here at school, which means Ladybug is a student at Françoise Dupont just like me, which means I probably know Ladybug already."

"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.474736571311951|" Marinette? Nah! Besides, you shouldn't be trying to find out more, if you discovered Ladybug's true identity you'd have to give your Miraculous back! So if I were you, I'd act like nothing's going on. That's what I always do when there's a problem, and it's always worked out just fine for me!"
"Adrien"|"Alec"|-0.216868281364441|" Maybe for once I'd better listen to you. Plagg, claws out! "
"Alec"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.68114972114563|"Let me go! I mean don't! Don't do that!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Kwamibuster"|0.716930747032166|"Excellent, Kwamibuster. Ladybug and Cat Noir will have to come to this MC's rescue."

"Cat Noir"|"Kwamibuster"|0.124568700790405|"There you have it, the answer was true. Ladybug defies the laws of science."
"Kwamibuster"|"Ladybug"|0.437803506851196|" I'm going to capture your Kwamis and prove to everyone that these magic creatures really do exist! True or false?"

"Cat Noir"|"Kwamibuster"|-0.429101884365082|" You're no scientist, you're more like a game show host!"
"Kwamibuster"|"Ladybug"|0.664966106414795|" I'm going to prove to the whole world that I am a great scientist and that I made a major discovery! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.606824606657028|"I hope your Kwami's learned his lesson so he doesn't ever do anything like this again!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.11328399181366|"Well, I heard your Kwami was with it."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.510908246040344|" My Kwami was trying to talk some sense into yours! I get the feeling you two are perfect match.Ah!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.1490318775177|" This Kwamibuster villain, she's from Françoise Dupont High School, right?"
"Ladybug"|"Kwamibuster"|-0.0121172666549683|" Don't forget the rules, Cat Noir. We can't know each other secret identiti- Ah! "

"Plagg"|"Tikki"|-0.250385999679565|" So how are you planning to get us out of here, Sugarcube?"
"Tikki"|"Kwamibuster"|-0.159262359142303|" I'm not, but I'm sure Ladybug will!"
"Kwamibuster"|"Marinette"|0.521586775779724|" I already have your Kwamis, and soon I'll have your Miraculous, too. True or false. "

"Nino"|"Chloé"|-0.338201880455017|"Oh, uhhh... Ladybug! Look over there!"
"Chloé"|"Nino"|-0.750782176852226|" Uhh, what kind of lame joke is this?"
"Nino"|"Chloé"|0.699397802352905|" Uhh, well, that was... Did you see Ladybug yesterday? Isn't she amazing? I wonder who she really is."
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.574450790882111|" Uhh... up too late DJ-ing, Nino? Obviously you didn't get your beauty sleep."
"Sabrina"|"Alya"|-0.252308785915375|" Uh... Chloé! Alya's looking in your locker!"
"Alya"|"Alya"|-0.527888029813766|" Uhh... that's a lie! I so was not! "
"Alya"|"Chloé"|-0.17355740070343|" Hey! Give it back!"
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.685124695301056|"Who's the little liar now?"
"Chloé"|"Alya"|-0.605453848838806|" She's guilty of invasion of privacy! I have proof!"
"Alya"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.73477628827095|" What?! Seriously! All I did was take a measly photo!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Chloé"|-0.694594979286194|" I'm sorry, Chloé. But there's no school policy on invasion of privacy."
"Chloé"|"Alya"|-0.123182654380798|" Then... then breaking and entering!"
"Alya"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.592152416706085|" I didn't break into her locker! It was open!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Chloé"|-0.661160320043564|" And nothing was stolen?"
"Chloé"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.512543529272079|" Only my very soul! My locker is my secret garden! He who enters uninvited burglarizes my inner being and steals my life force! "
"Mr. Damocles"|"Chloé"|-0.109484016895294|" Right. An hour of detention for you, Alya."
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.757351726293564|" Are my ears failing me? Did I hear you're giving one miserable hour of detention to a... a heinous criminal? Sabrina!"
"Sabrina"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.30070286989212|" The school rules clearly state that any student guilty of theft should be suspended for one full week."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Chloé"|-0.553609013557434|" Yes, but she's hardly stole anything."
"Chloé"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.613340497016907|" I'm not sure that my father would share your point of view. "
"Mr. Damocles"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.513326674699783|" Uhhh, well, now, Chloé, let's not bother your father, I mean, the honorable Mayor with a minor locker situation..."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Alya"|-0.5563043653965|" Ehhh... what I mean is, you're suspended for a week, Alya."
"Alya"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.723421841859818|" What?! That is so unfair! I am so gonna protest this on the school blog!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Alya"|-0.332469165325165|"The school blog is hereby suspended as well."
"Alya"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.312270522117615|"She's no superhero, she's super-psycho!"

"Hawk Moth"|"Alya"|0.337784886360168|" Lady Wifi, I heard through the grapevine that you're seeking to unmask Ladybug... I'd like to help you if you agree to help me too."

"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.666789352893829|" She's been suspended..."
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.612575769424438|" What?!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|0.347910523414612|" Marinette, if you're going to come late, would you please do it discretely?"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.672255873680115|" Sorry...What happened to her?"
"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.302466034889221|" The short story? Accused of breaking into Chloé's locker. I mean, Ladybug's locker..."
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.612575769424438|"WHAT?!?"
"Miss Bustier"|"Adrien"|-0.44811737537384|" That's it, Marinette! Go to the principal's office!"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.688395351171494|"What are you talking about?"
"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.0034746527671814|" Exactly what I said, bro. Alya says Chloé is Ladybug! She is crazy!"
"Marinette"|"Lady Wifi"|0.168050765991211|"Mr. Damocles?Sir?Huh?!"
"Lady Wifi"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.16472852230072|" I'm Lady Wifi, revealer of the truth! For our first exposé, your principal would like to share a little tidbit with you. So, Mr. Damocles, is it true you wrongly suspended a student named Alya today?"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Lady Wifi"|0.0083233118057251|"Uh... yes, it is."
"Lady Wifi"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.75088594853878|" So, you were biased? Unfair? Totally unjust?!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Marinette"|-0.150978088378906|" Yes, I was."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.411171972751617|" Oh, no! Alya! Tikki, time to transform!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.528337031602859|" You're going to have to fight your best friend!"
"Marinette"|" Marinette"|-0.628596603870392|" Nope! I'm gonna have to save my best friend!"
" Marinette"|"Lady Wifi"|-0.203119039535522|" Tikki, spots on! Yeah!"
"Lady Wifi"|"Miss Bustier"|0.510270118713379|" For my next scoop, I'll be taking you to meet the girl who's been hiding behind the Ladybug mask!Stay connected! "
"Miss Bustier"|"Adrien"|0.595355272293091|" Everyone, for your own safety, go directly home right now! And don't forget to read chapters four and five! "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.343511819839478|" If Chloé is Ladybug like Alya said, then Lady Wifi's gonna head straight for her house!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.616771221160889|"And it also means you must have a crush on Chloé! "
"Adrien"|"Cat Noir"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.533667862415314|" What? This can't be!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.408695340156555|" Who's being a sneaky kitty now?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.407197237014771|" Oh, Ladybug. But"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.356770992279053|" Come on, you don't actually believe she's the real Ladybug."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.553502202033997|" Yeah, of course not."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.314369678497314|" And besides, who would believe that she's the original Ladybug? She's obviously just a die-hard fan. A copycat?"
"Cat Noir"|"Chloé"|0.443967938423157|" Right."
"Chloé"|"Lady Wifi"|0.0623084306716919|"Hello? "
"Lady Wifi"|"Ladybug"|0.457785487174988|" Well, hello there, Ladybug! "
"Ladybug"|"Lady Wifi"|0.518320679664612|" We got Wifi! "
"Lady Wifi"|"Cat Noir"|0.304523110389709|"Well, well... So my hunch was correct in window.Everyone thinks the girl beneath the Ladybug costume is a little angel. Think again, people! The real Ladybug is... Chloé Bourgeois, everyone!Who are you?"
"Cat Noir"|"Lady Wifi"|-0.666423261165619|" Uhhh..."
"Lady Wifi"|"Cat Noir"|-0.561845868825912|"But I thought you were Ladybug!"
"Cat Noir"|"Lady Wifi"|-0.730735093355179|" Sorry to bust your news story. Next time, double-check your facts."
"Lady Wifi"|"Ladybug"|-0.562860935926437|" You'll be sorry. "
"Ladybug"|"Lady Wifi"|-0.557039171457291|" Alya?"
"Lady Wifi"|"Ladybug"|-0.383986115455627|" Alya's been disconnected. I'm Lady Wifi. News flash! Ladybug, let's find out who you really are!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.605737924575806|" Follow me!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.410732269287109|" So what's the plan?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0105701684951782|" She gets her powers from her phone, so let's lead her to the basement, where there is no service!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.699548006057739|" No service, no power. Nice one, my lady!"
"Ladybug"|"Lady Wifi"|-0.279306650161743|" We've gotta go lower!"
"Lady Wifi"|"Ladybug"|0.513786911964417|"I've got you now, Ladybug!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.586175084114075|" Get ready!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.328273952007294|" So, what do you do when you're not Ladybug?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.643207162618637|"Can't you see we're a little bit busy right now?She's gone back into the hotel!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.384005486965179|"She locked all the doors! Hey, you realize we might actually know each other in normal life."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.69136443734169|" Doubt it. It's locked!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.105618476867676|" She's left this one open."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0976938009262085|" Get ready for an ambush on 3. 1, 2, 3!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.302685797214508|" Ahhh... So much for the ambush."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.572890907526016|" Follow me. Where is she hiding? And what's up with all these phones?"
"Cat Noir"|"Lady Wifi"|-0.515083700418472|" How now, brown cow? I thought it was you she was after!"
"Lady Wifi"|"Ladybug"|-0.746852785348892|" Ha! You can't get me!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.220866560935974|" Yes I can. "
"Cat Noir"|"Lady Wifi"|-0.500231981277466|" No, no, no... Hold on in there, Ladybug!Of course! The service elevator!"
"Lady Wifi"|"Ladybug"|0.106194734573364|"Who is Ladybug? Is she a superhero or a super-weirdo? How can we trust the girl when we have no idea who she really is? We have the right to know!Why doesn't it come off?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.532133936882019|" Uhhh... because it's magic?"
"Cat Noir"|"Lady Wifi"|-0.34810072183609|" You're out of minutes, Lady Wifi!"
"Lady Wifi"|"Ladybug"|-0.0338714718818665|" Oh, how romantic. Tomcat's come to save his love bug."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.677793860435486|" I am not his love bug!"
"Cat Noir"|"Adrien"|0.628833293914795|" We'll come back to that later."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.125166475772858|" My ring!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.252876877784729|" Ooh... so chilly in here."
"Adrien"|"Lady Wifi"|0.291769504547119|" Where is it? I could use a little help!"
"Lady Wifi"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.110205948352814|" Well, well... what am I gonna do with both of you?"
"Hawk Moth"|"Lady Wifi"|0.47714364528656|" Get her to use her Lucky Charm! It'll force her to switch back, and her identity will be revealed, and her Miraculous will be mine."
"Lady Wifi"|"Ladybug"|-0.241719365119934|" If you don't get him outta there fast, your crush will soon be slush. Ha ha ha!Good luck with your cat popsicle! I have other news to cover! "

"Hawk Moth"|"Lady Wifi"|-0.249003171920776|" Don't let my Miraculous get away!"
"Lady Wifi"|"Cat Noir"|0.443967938423157|" Right!"

"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.320563852787018|"No more evildoing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! "
"Alya"|"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|-0.612575769424438|" What?"
"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|"Alya"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it!"

"Cat Noir"|"Alya"|-0.592222958803177|"Uhh... gotta go. You've only got a minute."
"Alya"|"Cat Noir"|-0.621568560600281|" So oh, no! Where did they go?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.292413234710693|" Stay!I won't tell anyone who you are. Cat's honor."
"Ladybug"|"Tikki"|-0.612914204597473|" Nobody must know who we really are. Not even us. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.507132828235626|" Phew, that was too close for comfort!"
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.214194297790527|" Tell me about it. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.566421270370483|" That was the chance to find out who the love of your life really is! What were you thinking?"
"Adrien"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.202356934547424|" That's the thing, Plagg. I wasn't thinking. I was following my heart."
"Hawk Moth"|"Tikki"|-0.297786891460419|" Your mask will fall one day, Ladybug. You'll have no choice then but to hand over your precious Miraculous! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.492885231971741|" Is that true? You're gonna tell him? Is that what your heart's saying?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.698150038719177|" Sometimes your heart tells you one thing, but a great superhero always listens to her head."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.471351742744446|" Got it!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.691964268684387|" Waaahhh!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.431513905525208|" Wanna see my new smartphone? It puts my old phone to shame! Just look at these pics!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.183335065841675|" Huh? What's with all these photos of Adrien?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.225636005401611|" Well... with a mask and a costume, don't you think he looks a little bit like Cat Noir?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.322068214416504|" Are you out of your mind? He's tons more legit than Cat Noir!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.730500459671021|" Hey! I happened to think that Cat Noir is pretty slick."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.699606537818909|" Anyway, stop taking photos of Adrien. Well, unless you give them to me, afterwards. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.262267053127289|" Give it back! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.598286598920822|" Nope!"
"Alya"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.682475715875626|" Oh, come on, Marinette! What if you drop it? Everyone knows how clumsy you are!"
"Male voice"|"Nooroo"|0.524509906768799|" I want that absolute power, Nooroo. I must have those Miraculous!"
"Nooroo"|"Male voice"|0.0307183265686035|" But nobody knows where these Miraculous are!"
"Male voice"|"Nooroo"|0.618249297142029|" I found you though, my little Nooroo. Your Miraculous... remind me of its powers again."
"Nooroo"|"Gabriel"|0.490099430084229|" The Moth Brooch allows you to give someone their own superpowers and to make that person your devoted follower!"
"Gabriel"|"Nooroo"|-0.0896901488304138|" And when it comes to luring superheroes, what could be better than creating supervillains?"
"Nooroo"|"Male voice"|-0.736477613449097|" But master, the Miraculous are not meant to be used for evil purposes!"
"Male voice"|"Nooroo"|0.557856440544128|" I must have this absolute power!Your Miraculous is in my control! I am your master now, and you must obey me."
"Nooroo"|"Male voice"|0.516639471054077|"Yes, master."
"Male voice"|"Wayzz"|0.556389689445496|"Nooroo, dark wings! Rise!From this day on, I shall be known as... Hawk Moth! "
"Wayzz"|"Wang Fu"|0.576686859130859|" Master, Master! "
"Wang Fu"|"Wayzz"|0.498542666435242|" Master, master... chanting, it's all part of the treatment. Master, master...Thank you for coming, see you again next week!"
"Wayzz"|"Wang Fu"|0.636194825172424|" Master, the Moth Miraculous, I felt its aura."
"Wang Fu"|"Wayzz"|-0.724052727222443|" I thought it had been lost forever!"
"Wayzz"|"Wang Fu"|-0.796199008822441|" But Master, it's a negative aura. I fear it may have gotten into the hands of a dark power!"
"Wang Fu"|"Wayzz"|-0.462577521800995|" We must find Nooroo and his Miraculous. If it has gotten into the wrong hands, there's no telling what evil will come upon the world!Time to transform! Wayzz... "
"Wayzz"|"Wang Fu"|0.221807479858398|" Please, Master. Be reasonable. You are–"
"Wang Fu"|"Sabine"|-0.451846480369568|" Still young! I'm only 186. But you're right, Wayzz. I can no longer do it alone. We'll need some help. "
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.707552671432495|" Marinette! Your alarm's been going off for fifteen minutes! You're going to be late for your first day back at school!"
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.183788418769836|"Got it, Mom!Coming! I bet you anything Chloé will be in my class again. "
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.132762849330902|" Four years in a row, is that possible? "
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.633057117462158|" Definitely. Lucky me!"
"Sabine"|"Tom"|-0.521025836467743|" Oh, don't say that! It's the start of a new year - I'm sure everything will be just fine!"

"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.668216288089752|" Well, that's easier said than done. She likes to make my life miserable."

"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.746829628944397|" Excellent, Adrien."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.0289397239685059|" Give me a minute, would you, Nathalie?"
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.42450737953186|" Yes sir."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.581124097108841|"You are NOT going to school. I already told you."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.576570004224777|" But Father!"
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.528265357017517|" Everything you need is right here where I can keep an eye on you. I will not have you outside in that dangerous world."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.57526370882988|" It's not dangerous, Father. I'm always stuck in here by myself. Why can't I go to school and make friends just like everyone else?"
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.727379083633423|" Because you are not like everyone else! You are my son! Continue."
"Nathalie"|"Roger"|0.659035444259644|" We can leave it there for today if you have– "

"News Crews"|"Nadja"|0.167616486549377|" Mr Bourgeois. Mr Bourgeois!"
"Nadja"|"Roger"|-0.178145527839661|" As incredible as it seems, it's been confirmed that Paris is indeed being attacked by a supervillain. The police have been struggling to keep the situation under control"
"Roger"|"Marinette"|0.282448291778564|" Be confident, the strong arm of the law will come crashing down on the... I mean, the other arm."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.751601979136467|" I hate first days back at school...Huh?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette and Adrien"|-0.515446186065674|"Huh?"
"Marinette and Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.0778021812438965|"What's this doing here? "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.791829958558083|" Ahh! Help! It's a giant bug! A... a mouse! A... a bug-mouse!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.661375045776367|" Everything's okay! Don't be scared!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.697025716304779|" Ahh! Bug mouse talks! "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.515547156333923|"No way... Like the genie in the lamp!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.773172974586487|"I met him once. So he grants wishes. Big deal! I'm way more personable! Plagg. Nice to meet you. Ooh, swanky... "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.611910253763199|" No! Don't touch that! Come back here!"
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|0.147038698196411|" Ooh! So shiny! Can you eat this?Argh, no, you can't! Ooh, what about this? "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.11669135093689|" Listen, Marinette. I know everything may seem a bit strange to you...Okay, if that makes you feel safer..."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.655368208885193|" What are you, and how do you know my name?"
"Tikki"|"Adrien"|-0.039772629737854|"I am a kwami, and my name is Tikki. Now just let me explain."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.344338536262512|"I still don't know what you're doing here."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.530577421188354|" Look, I'm a kwami. I grant powers. Yours is the power of destruction, got it?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.423653662204742|"Uh-uh."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.0946074724197388|"Good. Now, you got anything to eat? I'm starving..."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.645876944065094|"My dad's pranking me, right? Wait, he couldn't be. He has no sense of humor."
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.50425723195076|"Your father must never know that I exist! Or anyone for that matter."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.105965673923492|" Mom! Dad!"
"Tikki"|"Wayzz"|-0.514823079109192|" No, no, no!I'm your friend, Marinette! You must trust me. You're the only one who can stop Stoneheart!"
"Wayzz"|"Wang Fu"|0.473188757896423|" Do you think they'll be up to it, Master?"
"Wang Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.757215961813927|" I only got it wrong once. It will never happen again. At least I hope not. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.513417959213257|" This must be some mistake! The only superpower I could possibly have is super-awkwardness... I know! Alya would know! That's my friend. Well, at least I think she would... She loves superheroes! She'd totally be up for the job! You should totally go see her!"
"Tikki"|"Adrien"|0.0891146659851074|" Marinette, you are the chosen one! "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.176356375217438|" But I'm stuck here! I'm never even let to go to school! What good is a superhero who's imprisoned in his own house!"
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.546356350183487|"No good. That's why it's all going to change soon. If you're willing to change, that is. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.424775958061218|" Okay, so all I have to do is break the object where the whatchama-call-it is hiding?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.0314445495605469|" It's called an akuma. Which you must encapture."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.594080328941345|" Got it! Capture it! And what's that charm thing again?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.604654669761658|" The Lucky Charm! It's your secret superpower!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.281309008598328|" Aww... this is all going too fast, Tikki... I... won't be able to pull this off!"
"Tikki"|" Marinette"|-0.158642888069153|" Trust yourself, Marinette. Just say \"Spots on\"."
" Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.500442415475845|" Spots on?Whoa! What is happening?!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.360221385955811|" Claws out! That's how you transform."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.48315417766571|" Got it. Plagg, claws out!"
"Plagg"|"Cat Noir"|-0.603689789772034|" No, wait! I haven't finished explaining!- "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.308541893959045|" Too cool!"
"Ladybug"|"Nadja"|-0.741779893636703|" Aww... how does this thing come off? Tikki, if you can hear me, I want my normal clothes back. I'm not going anywhere! "
"Nadja"|"Ladybug"|0.476738095283508|" Stoneheart is heading toward the Montparnasse tower. The monster seems to be unstoppable!"
"Ladybug"|"Sabine"|-0.557039171457291|"Alya?"
"Sabine"|"Ladybug"|-0.100497245788574|" Marinette! Did you get home okay?"
"Ladybug"|"Sabine"|0.737113356590271|" Uhh... yeah, Mom! Just super! "
"Sabine"|"Ladybug"|0.167833209037781|" Marinette? You in here? Tom, we better call the school."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.548809051513672|" Okay, I have special powers!... and apparently this amazing super yo-yo thingy? "
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|0.369062423706055|"I'm starting to get the hang of this. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.41796612739563|" Well, hey there. Nice of you to drop in."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.666570544242859|" Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't do it on purpose."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.204301714897156|" I bet you're the partner my kwami told me about. I'm... Cat Noir. Yeah, Cat Noir. And you?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.715994566679001|" I'm Ma... err... Mar... uhh...Madly Clumsy. I'm so clumsy."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.0617192983627319|" No sweat, clumsy girl. I'm learning the ropes too."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.622828483581543|" Hey! Where are you going?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.0522745251655579|" To save Paris, right?"
"Ladybug"|"Stoneheart"|-0.192149519920349|" Ugh.Trust yourself, trust yourself... "
"Stoneheart"|"Cat Noir"|-0.573915511369705|" KIMMM!! So, who's wuss now?"
"Cat Noir"|"Stoneheart"|-0.771150261163712|" Hey, it's not very nice to pick on people who are smaller than you."
"Stoneheart"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.256144762039185|" I guess you're talking about yourself."
"Hawk Moth"|"Cat Noir"|0.00325429439544678|" Everything's going to plan. Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous have been activated. Here they come to save the day, and now my supervillain will destroy them."
"Cat Noir"|"Alya"|0.463550090789795|" Where are you, partner?"
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.412137627601624|" What are you waiting for, super red bug? The world is watching you!"
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.790965706110001|" Animal cruelty? How shameful!"
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.299741506576538|" Yes!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.74227911233902|" Sorry it took so long, Cat Noir."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.183118522167206|" It's cool, Wonderbug. Now, let's kick his rocky behind!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.35165935754776|" Wait! Haven't you noticed? He gets bigger and stronger with every attack. We have to do something different."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.465235888957977|" Different how?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.607399076223373|" Uhhh... I don't know."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.39455771446228|" Okay then. Let's use our powers. Cataclysm! Apparently I destroy whatever I touch."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.567831248044968|" I don't need a superpower to destroy everything."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.635732203722|" No, don't do that!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.0793757438659668|" Cool. It's just you and me now! Time to rumble, soon-to-be rubble!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.569366842508316|" Cat Noir! Wait!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.701919615268707|" Uh-oh. I guess I only get one shot to use my power. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.524564653635025|" And you only have five minutes before you transform back. Didn't your kwami explain anything to you?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.158439993858337|" I guess I was a little excited about my new life."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.750322103500366|" Well, up to me. Lucky Charm! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.57801878452301|" Super power?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.653361082077026|" My kwami told me I have to break the object where the whatchama-call-it... er, the akuma is hiding."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.34298038482666|" Well, he's made entirely out of stone."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.704278349876404|" His right hand, it's still closed. He never opens it. It's like the Russian dolls. The object isn't on him, it's hidden in his fist!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.541293740272522|" So what's your plan?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.16791832447052|" Hmmm...This!Don't resist. Trust me."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.366035342216492|" This girl's crazy! "
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.438308477401733|" Catch me if you can!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.271730303764343|" And now... Alya, the tap! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ivan"|0.759002447128296|" This girl is awesome. She's crazy awesome."
"Ivan"|"Cat Noir"|-0.2857626080513|" What's going on? What am I doing here?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.55086350440979|" You were incredible, miss... uh... Bug lady. You did it!"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug & Cat Noir"|0.59727418422699|" We both did it, partner."
"Ladybug & Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.00883841514587402|" You should get going. Our identities must remain secret."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.304256558418274|" Farewell, m'lady. Let's do this again soon, okay?"
"Ladybug"|"Ivan"|-0.0304120779037476|" Not too soon, I hope.\"You haven't even got the guts to tell Mylène you love her, wuss.\" Aw..."
"Ivan"|"Ladybug"|0.0239520072937012|" Kim wrote it. He's always making fun of me."
"Ladybug"|"Ivan"|-0.619323939085007|" You know, you shouldn't get so bent out of shape about that. There's no shame in telling someone you love them, Ivan."
"Ivan"|"Ladybug"|0.471336603164673|" Hey, how did you know my name, miss?"
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.611643075942993|" Uh..."
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.219985961914062|" Uncanny, amazing, spectacular! Are you gonna be protecting Paris from now on? How did you get your powers? Did you get stung by a radioactive Ladybug? Oh, I've got a ton of questions to ask you, uh, miss... uhh..."
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.00951355695724487|" Uhh... Ladybug! Call me Ladybug."
"Alya"|"Nadja"|0.693189024925232|" Ladybug... Super awesome!"
"Nadja"|"Marinette"|0.577672958374023|" So thanks to this amateur footage, the Parisians now know the identities of their heroes!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.37033474445343|" I did it, Tikki!"
"Tikki"|"Sabine"|0.417997241020203|" You see? You were up to it!"
"Sabine"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|0.471929430961609|"Marinette! Dinner time!"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Adrien"|0.768234372138977|" I am pleased to announce that we will organize a huge celebration in honor of our city's new protectors. Ladybug and Cat Noir."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.0496984720230103|" Ladybug. Her name is Ladybug..."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.646385818719864|" Eww, what is this?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.648656487464905|" Seriously? My personal chef made all this!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.272945523262024|" If you expect me to get my energy back after the transformation, i need to eat something more... delicate!"
"Adrien"|"Sabine"|0.576833724975586|" Okay. What do you want?"
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.389807522296906|"Oh my!"
"Marinette"|"Nadja"|-0.439915597438812|" Hmmm?"
"Nadja"|"Adrien"|0.315104246139526|" Just as Paris is about to celebrate the appearance of our two new superheroes, Ladybug and Cat Noir, a new wave of panic is sweeping across the capital as dozens of people are mysteriously transformed into stone monsters. It's simply unbelievable."
"Adrien"|"Nadja"|0.0521904230117798|" Camembert cheese. Fantastic. All he eats is Camembert, which means I'm gonna smell like stinky old cheese."
"Nadja"|"Adrien"|-0.0249303579330444|" These victims transformed into stone beings are still like statues. The police are perplexed to what will happen to them. Will they come back to life or be frozen in time forever?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.675675272941589|" Plagg? What's going on? I thought we defeated him."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.136356592178345|" What's capturing the akuma got to do with the other stone beings?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.029869556427002|" An akuma can multiply, that's why it must be captured. If Ivan's emotions become negative again, then the akuma will turn him back into Stoneheart! He'll control all the stone beings and bring them to life to serve as his army!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.773125067353249|" So that means... this is all my fault? I knew it! See, Tikki? I'm not cut out to be a superhero! I'm only gonna keep messing up."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.0670595169067383|" Keep calm. It was your first time. You're going to go back and capture Stoneheart's akuma, and do it successfully!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.739185124635696|" I can't! I told you, I'm clumsy! I create disaster all the time! I'll only make things worse for me, for you and for everyone. Cat Noir will be better off without me. I'm quitting."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.272393047809601|" SO I can't do anything without Ladybug?"
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.591526985168457|" Only Ladybug can capture akumas and repair damage caused by supervillains."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.710238456726074|" If Cat Noir can't capture the akumas, then... just find another Ladybug. I told you, I'm not cut out to be Ladybug!I'm sorry Tikki."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.54985311627388|" No, don't do tha"
"Marinette"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.749118745326996|" ...Tikki?I'm really sorry, Tikki..."
"Hawk Moth"|"Male voice"|-0.541437566280365|" Ivan has a sensitive heart. It won't be long before anger and sadness strike again. And he and the stone beings will come alive. Then we'll see how long you will remain hidden, Ladybug and Cat Noir. Once I have your Miraculous, you will be powerless against me.Everyone will be powerless against me! . I will have absolute power! Mwahahahaha!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.223945498466492|" What do you think, Plagg?"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.794179767370224|"Ugh, what's the point of giving someone something that can't be eaten and doesn't have a scent? If you gave me that, I'd be seriously offended."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.24499648809433|" Maybe I should get a second opinion."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.0576951503753662|" What is it?"
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.738757967948914|" It's a gift I've made for Marinette. We're organizing a surprise birthday party for her."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette?"
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.788711547851562|" You know, the girl who won the fashion contest? She made the hat I wore for your show. She's a really awesome girl. She loves helping others-"
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.696874111890793|" I don't remember giving you permission to go to your friend's birthday party."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.352672815322876|" Please, Father! Marinette deserves to have all her friends there."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.530261993408203|" Alright then."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.715640306472778|" Thank you, Father."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.587292939424515|" Ah..."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.731539249420166|" I always carry the lucky charm you gave me wherever I go, and I think it works pretty well. So.."
"Gabriel"|"Lila"|-0.738436043262482|" I thought you were supposed to protect Adrien from Marinette. The one you said was a bad influence."
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.388201773166656|" From now on, you and I are at war. You will lose your friends and wind up all alone and Adrien will soon be mine."
"Marinette"|"Lila"|0.542952656745911|" We'll see about that, Lila, we'll see."
"Lila"|"Lila"|0.408264636993408|" My plan is taking a little longer than expected, sir. But you won't be disappointed."
"Lila"|"Gabriel"|0.28348433971405|" Will you keep your promise if I succeed?"
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.494966745376587|" I always honor my commitments. "

"Gabriel"|"Lila"|-0.624233424663544|" Now's not the time to ease up, Nathalie."
"Lila"|"Marinette"|0.788978576660156|"I'm good friends with the best manga publisher in Japan, you know. I can talk to them about your comic book project if you like."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.637187242507935|" She's such a liar!"
"Alya"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.251589119434357|" You gotta stop obsessing over her, Marinette."
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|-0.00796669721603394|" I've graded your mock exam papers. Most of you did quite well, some better than others, but before I hand them back, Marinette, could you bring your schoolbag to me, please? I need to check something.Today, someone placed an anonymous note in my mailbox, claiming that you'd stolen the exam answers, and it looks like the anonymous person was right! "
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.541109204292297|" But that's not true! Someone must've planted that piece of paper in my bag!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|0.173953175544739|" But you've answered all of the questions correctly."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.283830165863037|" I did? Yes, but because I've studied."
"Alya"|"Lila"|0.346729636192322|" Miss Bustier, Marinette always scores high on your tests."
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.747935950756073|" This is so terribly unlike you, Marinette. You're usually so well-behaved."
"Marinette"|"Lila"|0.220953226089478|" Of course! You put the answers in my bag! You're the \"anonymous informer\"!"
"Lila"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.616275191307068|"I'm coming to your defense and you're accusing me?!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|-0.62348410487175|" You can't accuse someone without proof, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.725587069988251|" But I'm sure it's her! She stole the test answers!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|-0.74619847536087|" That's impossible, Marinette. Lila got the worst grade in the class."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.733056873083115|" Then... she flunked the exam on purpose!"
"Adrien"|"Alya"|-0.620480984449387|" Excuse me, Miss Bustier, but everyone here knows it isn't like Marinette to cheat."
"Alya"|"Rose"|0.0244362354278564|" He's right!"
"Rose"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.692518502473831|" It doesn't make sense! "

"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.672475904226303|" Too late. You already have."

"Mr. Damocles"|"Lila"|-0.528223216533661|" What happened over here?"
"Lila"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.580557852983475|" Marinette pushed me down the stairs!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Marinette"|-0.214001059532166|" In my office!"
"Marinette"|"Lila"|-0.684181183576584|" But, sir, it wasn't me! I didn't do anything!"
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.761264324188232|" I don't know why Marinette doesn't like me! I've really tried to be her friend, but she keeps calling me a liar, getting the others to gang up against me, and now, she's pushing me down the stairs? "
"Marinette"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.659026473760605|" Those are total lies!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Lila"|0.521598815917969|" Go on, Lila."
"Lila"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.218940496444702|" She even took a necklace I got from my grandmothera fox pendant!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Marinette"|-0.441338956356049|" Took, as in stole?"
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.709807902574539|" Huh? That's not true! I never stole anything!"
"Tom"|"Sabine"|-0.660750985145569|" My daughter is not a thief!"
"Sabine"|"Lila"|-0.675376087427139|" Why should we believe any of this? You're accusing her without any proof!"

"Mr. Damocles"|"Lila"|0.150321960449219|" Open your locker, please."
"Lila"|"Marinette"|0.299864530563354|"My Grandma's pendant!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.694674611091614|" She's making up this whole thing! It wasn't me! I didn't do anything, I swear!You know Lila's lying, don't you, Adrien?"
"Adrien"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.655096530914307|" Mr. Damocles, I don't think-"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.740248888731003|" Marinette Dupain-Cheng, you are expelled from this school! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Nathalie"|0.0793542861938477|" Lila Rossi was right! This was worth the wait! The downfall of Marinette brings about the despair of everyone who trusted her. I can feel the huge waves of negative emotions as they come crashing down!Are you ready, Nathalie?"
"Nathalie"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.154266119003296|" More than ever."
"Hawk Moth"|"Catalyst"|0.513827085494995|" Catalyst, I'm giving you back the power to transform me into Scarlet Moth."
"Catalyst"|"Scarlet Moth"|0.396366834640503|" From now on, you are the almighty Scarlet Moth!"
"Scarlet Moth"|"Scarlet Moth"|0.704667925834656|" Thanks to you, I can now release as many akumas as I desire! Fly away, my little akumas. Find Marinette and her friends and evilize them all!"
"Scarlet Moth"|"Scarlet Moth"|0.608792543411255|" Verity Queen, Princess Justice, I am Scarlet Moth."
"Scarlet Moth"|"Catalyst"|-0.474607169628143|" Since the innocent isn't to be believed anymore, I'm giving you both the power to expose the truth. As for you, my desperate loyal ones, disappointed by she who you once admired so much? I'm glad to have you back. In return, you will bring me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.What's wrong?"
"Catalyst"|"Scarlet Moth"|-0.681486338376999|" Nothing, everything's fine. Keep going-"
"Scarlet Moth"|"Tikki"|-0.386512696743011|" Dark wings fall!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.0563114285469055|" If you had been akumatized, nothing could have stopped you from having your Miraculous over to Hawk Moth!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.498125433921814|" And there would have been no more Ladybug. End of story."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.651040732860565|" We can't let that happen!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.527258664369583|" Neither Lila nor Hawk Moth will win. I'm gonna prove my innocence! If only Alya could help me."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.321710765361786|" Alya didn't become akumatized earlier today at school. I'm sure it's because she trusts you. Call her!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.344954013824463|" You're right!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.689147919416428|"So let's recap, right. You're accused of stealing the answers to the mock exam. Evidence 1: The paper with the answers was found in your schoolbag. You're also accused of pushing Lila down the stairs. No one witnessed the actual incident, but everyone did see Lila at the bottom of the staircase. You're also accused of stealing Lila's necklace, which was, Evidence 2, found inside your locker. And finally, you have a motive. I know for a fact that you've hated Lila from Day 1 because she hangs around Adrien."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.63564658164978|"I'm so glad I called you. Thanks for your support."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.422218680381775|" You're my best friend, Marinette. I totally believe you, but the evidence is stacked against you. The good thing is, the world's greatest reporters always seek the truth, so I'm gonna prove your innocence."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.417637705802917|"Thanks, Al! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.531227588653564|" First off, a culprit always leaves clues. That's a given. And by following these clues, it will lead us..."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.264452457427979|" ...to Lila!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.655048191547394|" No, to the guilty party. If you're so quick to accuse Lila, you might just overlook another potential baddie!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.695665687322617|" Oh.Right."
"Alya"|"Sabine"|-0.500988662242889|" Whoever it was had to have touched your locker when they put the necklace in there. I'm gonna go track down some fingerprints."
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.0707244873046875|" Marinette, can we have a word?"
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.544093132019043|" I'll meet you later at your place. "
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.173558712005615|" Now listen, honey, we love you but this whole thing has gotten very complicated. And until we've found a new school for you, we've decided that you should help us with the bakery."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.504056304693222|" But I'm telling you, I didn't do anything! If I have spent all my time in here, how am I going to be able to prove that I'm innocent?"
"Tom"|"Doctor"|0.748061895370483|" It's fun here at the bakery. You'll see. "
"Doctor"|"Gabriel"|0.295683026313782|" Once again, Mr. Agreste, make sure she gets lots of rest."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.537240505218506|" Of course. Thank you, doctor. "
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.46147221326828|" Perhaps you can still take advantage of the chaos that Lila Rossi has reeked. "
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.623782813549042|" That plan is pointless without you."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.00624287128448486|" You're right. Then I have to... "
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.594932556152344|" There will be no more Catalyst, or Mayura. I warned you.Using a broken Miraculous ends up breaking its wearer. The wounds of the Miraculous are becoming your wounds."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.376502692699432|" I don't care, Gabriel. I want to help you."
"Gabriel"|"Duusu"|-0.584032893180847|" Not at that cost. Never at that cost again."
"Duusu"|"Nathalie"|0.160568594932556|" Yay! You're feeling better already!Oh no! Spoke too soon! But then, what are we doing here?"
"Nathalie"|"Duusu"|0.475414991378784|" Gabriel would never allow me to do this, but I'm going to create a very powerful sentimonster. The most powerful one that's ever existed. "
"Duusu"|"Nathalie"|-0.685726881027222|" No, don't do that! You should be resting."
"Nathalie"|"Duusu"|0.653583526611328|" Gabriel so desperately wants the Miraculous, and I want to be the one to give it to him!"
"Duusu"|"Nathalie"|0.581611394882202|" Ah, oh, oh! It's so romantic!"
"Nathalie"|"Mayura"|0.214978337287903|" Duusu, spread my feathers!"
"Mayura"|"Sentimonster Ladybug"|0.496027112007141|"Go, my beautiful amok, and bring my creation to life.Ladybug, I am Mayura. You are Cat Noir's true teammate, and you've one goal. To get hold of the Miraculous. "
"Sentimonster Ladybug"|"Tom"|0.63262414932251|" I'm ready, Mayura."
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.182581424713135|" Always make sure you got your right angles there. Then you fold the pastry, folded toward first, about two-thirds of the way. "
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.375395894050598|"Can I please answer?"
"Tom"|"Marinette's voicemail"|-0.679581224918365|"We're not done with our flaky pastry yet."
"Marinette's voicemail"|"Alya"|-0.232840418815613|" It's Marinette. Leave a message."
"Alya"|"Nadja"|-0.72300311923027|" Okay, so here's the skinny on my investigation so far. No fingerprints, no evidence. Whoever did this was very thorough. I'm sorry. We'll be in touch."
"Nadja"|"Mayura"|0.395957469940186|"This is Nadja Chamack, live from the Arc de Triomphe, where Ladybug is battling against a new supervillain."
"Mayura"|"Plagg"|-0.174897789955139|" I am Mayura, and I'm about to annihilate Ladybug. Mwahahaha! "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.481498599052429|" Don't tell me, we have to go and help your lady."
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.232147812843323|" She and I are on the same team, Plagg. We'll help Marinette, but first..."

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.585890978574753|" It must be one of Hawk Moth's traps!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.497857511043549|" I gotta get there before Cat Noir gets tricked!"
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.371483325958252|" Oh, I'm such a klutz! Can I go change my clothes, Dad?"
"Tom"|"Cat Noir"|-0.24017596244812|" No need, sweetie. Don't worry, a good baker is never afraid to get dirty. You can change after you're done decorating these gingerbread men."
"Cat Noir"|"Sentimonster Ladybug"|-0.361561715602875|" You okay?"
"Sentimonster Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.767802715301514|" Don't worry about me. Go after Mayura. Ow! Cat Noir, I don't feel so good..."
"Cat Noir"|"Mayura"|-0.761066615581512|" There's something wrong, we're supposed to be nearly invulnerable!"
"Mayura"|"Sentimonster Ladybug"|-0.188253462314606|" He doesn't suspect a thing. Grab his Miraculous, his ring, before the real Ladybug gets here!"

"Sentimonster Ladybug"|"Mayura"|-0.568481415510178|" It's... it's over. After all this time, I've realized that you're always here for me, even when I keep rejecting you. Your feelings haven't changed, and mine are growing stronger every day. I can't pretending anymore."

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.211789548397064|" But she's so much more elaborate than any of those we've faced before! She's so perfect, there's nothing monstrous about her at all!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.571299999952316|" Sorry kitty, but you should have known. I'm nowhere near as perfect as her."

"Gabriel"|"Nooroo"|-0.457544088363647|" Nathalie?Nooroo, why didn't you wake me up?!"
"Nooroo"|"Ladybug"|-0.627797901630402|" I couldn't bring myself to, Master. You were sleeping so peacefully."
"Ladybug"|"Mayura"|-0.626165717840195|" Mayura looks exhausted. That's our chance to bring her down. And find out who's behind the mask.Cover your ears! "
"Mayura"|"Cat Noir"|-0.586760878562927|" No!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.433070659637451|" What's going on?"
"Ladybug"|"Sentimonster Ladybug"|-0.227735579013824|" You're right. There's nothing monstrous about her. Whoever possesses this controls the sentimonster, she couldn't help but follow orders.Sentimonster, you're free now. I won't give you orders, but I ask you, help us grab Mayura's Miraculous."
"Sentimonster Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.550232172012329|" Thank you, Ladybug. I will help you."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.640989542007446|" Are we cool, or are we cool? We could call ourselves Cat Noir and his Ladybugs."
"Ladybug"|"Sentimonster Ladybug"|0.747136950492859|" I prefer the bugettes and kitty cat. What do you think?"
"Sentimonster Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.169795274734497|" You're in charge, Ladybug."
"Cat Noir"|"Mayura"|-0.749813377857208|" Ugh, I should've guessed."
"Mayura"|"Cat Noir"|0.427764773368835|" I release you from existence. "
"Cat Noir"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.285566508769989|"How could you!? "
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|0.509807467460632|" Getting sentimental on a sentimonster?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.603027939796448|" Hawk Moth!"
"Cat Noir"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.396242439746857|" You're the real monster!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0994516611099243|" Oh, that? You'll find out very soon."
"Cat Noir"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.392533600330353|" We've missed you, Grandpa! You don't mind me calling you Grandpa, right?"
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|0.060238242149353|" You won't be joking around when I take your Miraculous!"
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.271355032920837|" Cat Noir, cover me! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|-0.285600483417511|"Check, Ladybug!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.586760878562927|" No!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.726003736257553|" Cataclysm!"
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.315884649753571|" Good move, Kitty. Now all I have to do is grab Mayura's Miraculous and it's over. Checkmate, Hawk Moth. You better surrender."
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|-0.210421681404114|"All I need to do is wait a few minutes until you and your pet transform back into regular kids. So fragile, so easy to break."
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.451752364635468|" Release him!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Mayura"|-0.409873127937317|" Release her!"
"Mayura"|"Cat Noir"|-0.677003562450409|" Don't mind me."
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.697798103094101|" Don't listen to him."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.0147677659988403|" You had Mayura right where you wanted her. I could've managed by myself. Why'd you do that?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.332152962684631|"Because we're Ladybug and Cat Noir. Ladybug by itself doesn't sound half as cool. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.736326187849045|" You shouldn't say things like that to me. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.366857349872589|" But the real Ladybug's heart still belongs to someone else."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.388568103313446|" I should've guessed that, too."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.223827004432678|" Miraculous Ladybug! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.411263048648834|" I guess even your Miraculous Ladybug can't bring our Bugette back."
"Ladybug"|"Gabriel"|-0.720554530620575|" The Peacock's superpower can be so cruel when wrongly used. Even more than the Butterfly's one."
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|-0.574170142412186|" You've disobeyed me again, Nathalie. And you put yourself in danger for nothing."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.365123152732849|"Your idea was brilliant, but you don't need a Miraculous to help me."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.376436471939087|" There is something else you needed Mayura for. To find the Guardian."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.632438153028488|" I'm not so sure anymore."
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|0.629153609275818|"If you ever need Mayura again, I'll be here for you."
"Adrien"|"Vincent"|0.612814664840698|"Thank you."
"Vincent"|"Adrien"|0.0292065143585205|" Oh, Adriano! ¿Cómo estás?"
"Adrien"|"Vincent"|0.651936054229736|" I'm good. Thanks, Giuseppe.Lila?"
"Vincent"|"Lila"|0.673433303833008|" Do you know each other? Oh my, your papa's new muse is incredible! She's been all around the world, she knows all the celebrities, and she's Italian, just like me!"
"Lila"|"Adrien"|0.608078122138977|" Hi, Adrien. You're gonna give me tons of tips, because I'm not as experienced as you are. "
"Adrien"|"Vincent"|-0.619905769824982|" Would you mind leaving us alone for a second?"
"Vincent"|"Adrien"|0.554346323013306|" Sure. "
"Adrien"|"Lila"|-0.66707181930542|"I warned you once already, Lila, but you didn't listen. You hurt my friend Marinette, and that's not okay."
"Lila"|"Adrien"|-0.719672292470932|" Me? Hurting Marinette? But she's the one who-"
"Adrien"|"Lila"|-0.500375121831894|" I don't know how to prove you lied, Lila, because you're good at it. So you'll just have to come up with another lie, just as convincing. Only this time it's gonna prove Marinette's innocent."
"Lila"|"Adrien"|-0.668219417333603|" Why would I do that, Adrien?"
"Adrien"|"Lila"|-0.102920055389404|" Because we're friends, aren't we?"
"Lila"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.685047209262848|" And because of this rare disease, sometimes I can't control things I say. I'm really sorry, Marinette."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Marinette"|0.00468599796295166|" Thank you for your confession, Lila. It's very moving. Marinette, you will of course be allowed back in the school tomorrow. "
"Marinette"|"Lila"|-0.390044450759888|" People should know better. Things aren't always what they seem to be at first sight. So look, I don't know why you felt the urge to start all this, or why all of a sudden you lied to fix this mess, but I'm glad to see you're capable of coming back to your senses. Sometimes."
"Lila"|"Tom"|-0.0954192280769348|" As you said, things aren't always what they seem to be at first sight. "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.144354581832886|" I knew my daughter was innocent all along."
"Sabine"|"Alec"|-0.300763726234436|" Oh, aren't those your classmates?"
"Alec"|"Sabine"|0.686959385871887|"And this week, we'll be visiting the set of Gabriel Agreste's most recent photoshoot for an exclusive interview with his new muse, Miss Lila. "
"Sabine"|"Adrien"|-0.162133753299713|" I'm glad her disease doesn't stop her from following her dreams."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.688699960708618|" Master Fu translated are too cryptic. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.22873842716217|" Their meanings are hidden on purpose, to protect the secret of our magic powers."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.0578423738479614|" Yeah but what good does it do if even the Guardian of the Miraculous, can't figure them out?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.34565544128418|" Master Fu had trouble too with the first ones and remember, you were the one who helped him with the aqua power!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.22623085975647|"You're right, I'm gonna figure this out! "
"Tikki"|"Nadja"|0.0587928295135498|"What are you doing? "
"Nadja"|"Alec"|0.702250123023987|"The city of Paris is getting ready to celebrate the famous Prince Ali's birthday— "
"Alec"|"Marinette"|0.580197930335999|"This special report on the fascinating life of Adrien Agreste!"
"Marinette"|"Alec"|-0.388314068317413|"Adrien… "
"Alec"|"Vincent"|0.645080924034119|" We were able to spend the entire day with this famous, young model! "
"Vincent"|"Adrien"|0.68443763256073|"Perfect! Just-a Stunning! Mwah! I need a smile more al dente! Haha!"
"Adrien"|"Sarah"|-0.0885195732116699|"How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? "
"Sarah"|"Marinette"|-0.0392116904258728|"Not bad but could you do it for me with a bit more… orange? "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.509647607803345|"What a fascinating life."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.665507763624191|"What a boring day."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.642157942056656|" Without even a lunch break. Ridiculous!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.610082387924194|"Finally! Free at last! Plagg, claws out! "

"Cat Noir"|"Citizens"|-0.220435619354248|"Maybe it's because now since you're Guardian of the Miraculous,you've got all sorts of more important things to dobut hey, no biggie. I'm just the Cat for this job. I'll start without you. Hope to meet up with you later. Let me know. "
"Citizens"|"Cat Noir"|0.119065403938293|"Cat Noir! Cat Noir! Cat Noir!"

"Mr. Ramier"|"Cat Noir"|0.178837299346924|" Thank you for asking Cat Noir but I am in the best of spirits, really!"
"Cat Noir"|"Mr. Ramier"|-0.701754957437515|"Well I guess I'm out of here then. "
"Mr. Ramier"|"Cat Noir"|0.763362646102905|"Say hello to the lovely Ladybug for me!"
"Cat Noir"|"Plagg"|0.762351989746094|" Sure thing… if I ever see her…"

"Cat Noir"|"Chloé"|0.193524122238159|"Something tells me an akuma is going to show up!"
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.408361732959747|" Hmm?Oh my purse!You dingbat!You could have told me that I was wearing it! "

"Kagami"|"Cat Noir"|-0.642511278390884|" Yes, never let yourself be weak, mother. I know that lesson well."
"Cat Noir"|"Tomoe"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh? "
"Tomoe"|"Kagami"|-0.630375951528549|" And never be—"
"Kagami"|"Tomoe"|0.310808658599854|" Taken by surprise. "
"Tomoe"|"Kagami"|-0.425733923912048|"Don't apply these principles to fencing, you'll never be as good as Adrien Agreste!"
"Kagami"|"Cat Noir"|0.087726354598999|" Adrien? Don't worry mother.I've got everything I need to succeed with him."
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.346878826618195|"Patrol's over, Bugaboo! "
"Cat Noir"|"Plagg"|-0.454914927482605|" Claws in. "
"Plagg"|"Nathalie"|-0.430065155029297|"So your favorite cheese is missing from the plate and it's as if the others don't exist? Try another type, you might be surprised how much you like it! "
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|0.102555274963379|"Ms. Kagami Tsurugi called to inform you that the time of your fencing has been changed to one hour earlier this week."
"Adrien"|"Tomoe"|0.428837895393372|"Huh, thank you, Nathalie.Kagami, Kagami… "
"Tomoe"|"Kagami"|-0.72002699971199|"All these scheduling changes requested by the Agrestes are annoying. But you can use it to fit in another hour of Russian."
"Kagami"|"Gabriel"|-0.0654848217964172|"Yes, mother."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.661313474178314|" All these scheduling changes requested by the Tsurugi are annoying. When you get home, make sure you try on the outfit I've just completed for your next photoshoot."
"Adrien"|"Mr. Haprèle"|0.263217926025391|"Yes, father."
"Mr. Haprèle"|"Kagami"|-0.678235501050949|" Kagami? Adrien? Your fencing class doesn't start for an hour. And Mr. D'Argencourt hasn't arrived yet."
"Kagami"|"Mr. Haprèle"|-0.381192445755005|" Oh really? And I was sure I wrote down the correct hour this time!"
"Mr. Haprèle"|"Kagami"|-0.650692403316498|" I'm sorry but you can't—"
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|0.11729884147644|"Stay at school without adult supervision? No problem, Mr. Haprèle. We'll come back for the class in an hour."

"Adrien"|"Kagami"|0.344982266426086|" The arts and crafts room? What are you planning to do in here?"
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|0.115278005599976|"I've never told this to anyone but… I love to draw. I always have.Drawings never lie. The poses that people make are always a reflection of their personality.But my mother won't let me do it, according to her, I'm not good enough…"
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|0.483214497566223|" You're super talented Kagami!"
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.0955424308776855|" You really think so?"
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.0496507883071899|" Mmhm"
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|0.546934485435486|"Pose for me, I want to sketch you."
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|0.526083588600159|" How do you want me to pose? "
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.237754762172699|" However makes you comfortable.I really admire Toulouse Lautrec. I'd like to draw you just like the characters he painted. Did you know he often signed his drawings with a monogram like many Japanese artists did?This isn't right, it's not you. "
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|0.498892068862915|" Can I see it? "
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.355696141719818|"Try a different pose. It should be easy to do a beautiful sketch of you because you're so handsome but what I want is to capture the real you inside.No, still not good. Change againThese are all modeling poses!Try something that's more natural, more you."
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.19883006811142|" Hmm, what about MEOW!Uhh…I mean now? "
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.652057617902756|" No, you're not at all natural. "
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|0.589294195175171|"Yes, I am. I promise, this is me!"
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.674596399068832|" NO!That's you when you're being silly! "
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.0760612487792969|"What if when I'm being silly, I'm really me?"
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|0.419937252998352|"There. This is really you."
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.305269658565521|"Do you really think?… "
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|0.656171441078186|" Yes, you're, perfect. "
"Adrien"|"Mr. D'Argencourt"|0.579216718673706|"Now it's really time for our fencing class. "

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.63545548915863|" Will you cut it out with your practical jokes? I could have really hurt you."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.762530982494354|"M'lady, the only thing that really hurts me is when you make me go on patrol by myself.I even missed your little angry pout."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.734577178955078|" Sorry Kitty Cat, I'm a bit over my head at the moment"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.661160707473755|" I bet! \"Guardian of the Miraculous\", big name, big responsibility!"

"Ivan"|"Rose"|0.279561519622803|" We can go over it again if you want, Adrien?"
"Rose"|"Kagami"|0.443155407905579|" Yeah, let's play it again."
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|0.365031838417053|" Adrien, it's time!"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.468848466873169|" Five more minutes? "
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.211169123649597|" Well… I'll be better next time, I promise. See you guys. "
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.643087893724442|" Our cars aren't here yet. That's too bad; we could have played the song again."
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|0.417358994483948|" But this way we have a little time together."

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.684636354446411|" Woo hoo!M'lady, it's been awhile since I've had that much fun."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.298792898654938|"If battling a supervillian with three eyes and a giant monster buddy is your idea of fun, I can't imagine what your other days are like…"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.424817800521851|" A baddie, a sentimonster, and Shadow Moth. It's even more exciting with his new name don't ya think? "

"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.599281996488571|"Oh you know just that thing, that Lucky Charm that Marinette gave me.Ah no, did I lose it?!Again…"
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.599387794733047|" You mean…this one?You know, I lied too. I lied to my mother so that we could see each other. I even lied to her when I said you came here with me tonight. I lied at every fencing lesson so we could spend more time together. You see, we're both a couple of liars. Except I lie because I want to be with you.You lie… because you don't want to be with me."
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.518932223320007|"Kagami!"

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.611392617225647|" Not if I've always told the truth. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.569500148296356|" Yeah, but is that the case? "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.478935360908508|" Hardly. How 'bout you?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.682083576917648|" Of course not Kitty, we're supposed to lie. If only to keep our identities a secret. And if we touch that thing they'll be no one left to stop her from swallowing all of Paris! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.0907511711120605|" Okay, so what do we do? "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.514894008636475|" Lucky Charm!Uh.."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.428588151931763|" I can't wait to see what you're gonna do with a drone. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.560411304235458|" Okay, we can't go inside, but I doubt this machine ever lied. Which means… keep her busy while I send this spy bird inside! We'll stay in touch. "

My name isn't Cat Noir, I'm not a superhero, I hate Ladybug, and I think Shadow Moth should have been called Peacock Moth! Way funnier! I forgot, my favorite dish is cauliflower with béchamel sauce."
"Shadow Moth"|"Lies"|-0.155866503715515|" Lies, catch that deceiving Cat and seize his Miraculous!"

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.190396547317505|" Great, so break it! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.675333350896835|" How do I do that when I can't touch it? "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.494134366512299|" You're right, only someone who's never lied can get into that sphere and do it but that doesn't exist!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0734360218048096|" Yes, it does Cat Noir! It does exist! Fang! Jagged Stone's crocodile. He's never lied. He's an animal, he wouldn't know how!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.344954013824463|" You're right!"
"Ladybug"|"Citizens"|0.420340538024902|" It's working!"

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.564256399869919|" But if Lies sees him coming we're toast! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.390773475170135|" There are only two liars left in Paris and one of them knows the ultimate way to catch her attention. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.676032662391663|" No way! Don't do it! What if I fail?! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.678574442863464|" You know what? I trust you."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.636191606521606|" Cat Noir no! You're completely crazy!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.566859126091003|" Crazy about you, M'lady. "
"Ladybug"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.734170109033585|" No, just plain crazy… reckless… "
"Shadow Moth"|"Ladybug"|0.0191396474838257|" The moment of truth is near! Grab Cat Noir's Miraculous, then it'll be Ladybug's turn!"
"Ladybug"|"Shadow Moth"|0.508568525314331|" Hurry up!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Ladybug"|-0.628351271152496|" NOOO!!!"
"Ladybug"|"Citizen"|-0.512003213167191|" No more evil doing for you little akuma! Time to de-evilize! Gotcha! Bye bye little butterfly! Miraculous Ladybug! "
"Citizen"|"Ladybug"|0.261122941970825|" Yeah!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.709237545728683|"Seriously, you've got to stop doing this to me!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|-0.587214708328247|"Yeah, but I can't resist this angry little pout of yours when you bring me back. "
"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it."
"Cat Noir"|"Adrien"|-0.454914927482605|" Claws in."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.674416363239288|"Ladybug."
"Plagg"|"Mr. D'Argencourt"|0.633565068244934|" Oh how romantic! I get it, even if I do love every cheese on the plate, I always come back to my favorite, Camembert. "
"Mr. D'Argencourt"|"Adrien"|0.248676061630249|" En garde, prèt, allez!"
"Adrien"|"Mr. D'Argencourt"|-0.758295714855194|"Ugh ah ouch! "
"Mr. D'Argencourt"|"Adrien"|-0.727360248565674|"Stop it! This is a fencing class here, not a joust. Fall out! "
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.632931381464005|" I'm really sorry I hurt you Kagami. You know, all those wonderful times we had together… they weren't lies. "
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|0.616161823272705|" I know. I know that you're hiding something but I also know that there is sincerity in you too."
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.082560122013092|" So… can we still be friends? "
"Kagami"|"Cat Noir"|-0.421955406665802|" How can you trust someone who's lied to you?When I'm ready to see you again, I'll let you know. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|-0.652203589677811|" You know the difference between us and the rest of the world M'Lady? We can't be completely honest with each other. We keep secrets and… sometimes we have to lie."
"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.258484601974487|" But we always trust each other. "
"Chloé-Bee"|"Chloé-Bug"|0.75386655330658|"Welcome to my secret lair. I may be a superhero, but I'm always happy to share my thrilling life with all my fans. Like today, my dear friend Ladybug showed up to ask me for advice."
"Chloé-Bug"|"Chloé-Bee"|0.734575986862183|" I admire Queen Bee so much. She showed me what being a superhero is all about and always fixes the messes Cat Noir and I get ourselves into."
"Chloé-Bee"|"Chloé-Bug"|0.551222324371338|" Oh, please. You would do the same for me."
"Chloé-Bug"|"Chloé-Bee"|-0.743914127349854|" Come on! Like you would ever cause a mess."
"Chloé-Bee"|"Ivan"|0.344954013824463|" You're right. "
"Ivan"|"Chloé"|-0.418773651123047|" That's not Ladybug, that's you, Chloé! "
"Chloé"|"Miss Bustier"|0.297783374786377|" Of course that's the real Ladybug! "
"Miss Bustier"|"Chloé"|0.213247656822205|" But Chloé, could you tell me why you chose to do an assignment about yourself? Uh— I mean: about Queen Bee?"
"Chloé"|"Chloé-Bug"|0.587724447250366|" Well, our assignment was to choose an important person in French history and I actually saved France. Even Ladybug says so… "
"Chloé-Bug"|"Chloé-Bug and real Chloé"|0.6545649766922|"Queen Bee really makes us stronger…"
"Chloé-Bug and real Chloé"|"Alya"|0.734932065010071|" …she truly is Miraculous."
"Alya"|"Chloé"|-0.545428305864334|" Chloé, it's so obvious that's you dressed up as Ladybug. You didn't even bother to match her hair color."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.673553496599197|" Uh… she… just… dyed her hair blonde to look like me.Ugh, you're all a bunch of losers!Except you, Adrikins. None of you deserve to see the rest of my documentary."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.799086675047874|"Oh, what a shame. "
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.760385125875473|" Uh?I saw you laughing with the other idiots; you're fired!"
"Sabrina"|"Alya"|-0.719432234764099|"Whahaha, I betrayed my best friend! "
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.67894458770752|" How could you not laugh, Sabrina? The whole superherositchhas totally gone to her head. "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.679107248783112|"You're the one who paralyzed the Métro driver, aren't you? You used your power to create this situation!"
"Alya"|"Alix"|0.0147402286529541|" She wasn't the hero; it was Cat Noir and Ladybug!"
"Alix"|"Marinette"|-0.316815078258514|" She had superpowers for like five minutes and went totally outta control!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.554103314876556|" We might not deserveto see your documentary, but you don't deserve to be called a superhero!"
"Chloé"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.718288898468018|" What?!You will pay for your insulting remarks, Dupain-Cheng!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Chloé"|-0.678936183452606|" Calm down now, students!"
"Chloé"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.73761460185051|"This is ridiculous."
"Miss Bustier"|"Chloé"|-0.073975145816803|" Chloé, class isn't over."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.553186684846878|" You're all ridiculous. Utterly riii-diculous. "
"Marinette"|"André"|-0.68480721116066|" Ugh— seriously? She'll never change."
"André"|"Audrey"|0.564001321792603|" By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife."
"Audrey"|"Chloé"|-0.661188542842865|"Oh, good. You're married. Now get out!"
"Chloé"|"André"|-0.779416173696518|"Shoo! "
"André"|"Audrey"|-0.334914088249207|" What in the world is going on, my sweetie pie?"
"Audrey"|"Chloé"|0.148096561431885|"I demand that you close the school down for good!"
"Chloé"|"Audrey"|-0.572119474411011|"And I want you to banish Marinette Dupain-Cheng from Paris!"
"Audrey"|"Chloé"|-0.738757014274597|"That monster hurt your little girl’s feelings."
"Chloé"|"André"|-0.408628523349762|" She got the whole class to gang up on me. They all have to pay."
"André"|"Audrey"|-0.591931968927383|" But I just can't! I mean… I could close the school for a few days… a week at most."
"Audrey"|"Chloé"|-0.708776146173477|"Not good enough!"
"Chloé"|"André"|-0.481547832489014|"Shut it down forever!"
"André"|"Chloé"|-0.219074845314026|" Ugh— But that’s impossible! I love you, Chloé, but you’re asking too much of me this time. I’m only the mayor."
"Chloé"|"Chloé and Audrey"|-0.764466851949692|" Precisely.What’s the use of this stupid sash you're wearing if you can’t actually use power? This is ridiculous!..."
"Chloé and Audrey"|"André"|-0.785559520125389|" Utterly ridiculous!"
"André"|"Audrey"|-0.779832497239113|" You’ve always been too good for your classmates. Maybe you should switch schools? "
"Audrey"|"André"|-0.657319992780685|" Change schools? Ugh— forget it! We need to change cities, that’s what. We’ll go to New York!"
"André"|"Chloé"|-0.17847728729248|" But wait!"
"Chloé"|"Butler Jean"|0.696685433387756|" Don't forget my Tourbillon stilettos, Jean-Marc."
"Butler Jean"|"André"|0.36638081073761|" Of course, Miss."
"André"|"Chloé"|-0.611078917980194|" I can’t be the mayor of Paris if we’re living in New York. It’s… too far! Why don't we go and live closer in Versailles, instead?"
"Chloé"|"Audrey"|-0.665251344442368|" Well, it won’t make the slightest bit of difference since you’re so powerless, anyway!"
"Audrey"|"André"|-0.761350184679031|" Not only are you incapable of solving a simple problem for your daughter, you’re also refusing to come with us?"
"André"|"Chloé"|-0.557433307170868|" No! Not at all. I… I… Ah. Look at this, my sweetie. It’s for you. "
"Chloé"|"André"|-0.255216121673584|" What is it? It’s tiny!"
"André"|"Chloé"|-0.680377721786499|" Yes, but very expensive! It’s a diamond-encrusted phone case. Are you sure you don’t want to stay after all?"
"Chloé"|"André"|-0.7438083589077|"I don’t want that thing! What kind of daddy are you if you can’t even give me what I want?"
"André"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.326624810695648|"But… what more can I do?"
"Hawk Moth"|"André"|-0.601202249526978|" A man of power feeling helpless as a father. I sense very strong negative emotions from him.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize him!"
"André"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.628351271152496|" Nooo! "
"Hawk Moth"|"André"|-0.442848920822144|"Malediktator , I am Hawk Moth. Your wife and daughter think you're weak and useless? Well, I shall give you absolute power. Anything you declare will happen!"
"André"|"Chloé"|0.468034863471985|" By the power vested in me, I shall prevail as Malediktator! "
"Chloé"|"Nino"|-0.657779902219772|"Hey there, losers! I'm headed to New York with my mom.I'm leaving you all behind in your pathetic little school and your pathetic little city. Adieu! "
"Nino"|"Nathaniel"|-0.712991714477539|" Chloé's leaving?"
"Nathaniel"|"Marinette"|0.139671325683594|" Forever?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.398019433021545|" Looks like it."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.261122941970825|" Yeah."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.666115045547485|" Without Chloé around, Paris will be filled with a lot less negative emotion!"
"Tikki"|"Adrien"|-0.591653436422348|" And less akumatizations."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.604442834854126|" Hey, what’s going on here? What are we celebrating?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.611436814069748|" Chloé’s gone! She’s moving to New York!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.0670545697212219|" Chloé left…? For good?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.545393824577332|"Yeah! Isn’t it great?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.397122800350189|" Uh… no. I think it’s terrible! How can you celebrate a thing like that?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.762672081589699|"But, Chloé’s a total brat to everyone. She was useless anyway."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.550102531909943|" Nobody's useless, not even Chloé. When I was little and wasn't allowed out, she was the only friend I had."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.632356405258179|" Ow— well, uh… shoot."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.736347913742065|" She left angry and unhappy. I can't celebrate that. "
"Marinette"|"Malediktator"|-0.731166064739227|" Uh—I'm really sorry, Adrien."

"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.713221460580826|" Yeah, but I think I was a bit harsh on her earlier. What if Adrien's right and Chloé isn't just a brat?"

"Butler Jean"|"Ladybug"|0.511785745620728|" Of course."

"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.721117675304413|" I'm fine with helping you, Chloé, but first… I need you to tell me what happened. Why is your father— I mean, Malediktator, so mad?"
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.691714584827423|" It's because of this super lame loser named Marinette Dupain-Cheng. She's this horrible girl in my class and she hates me.She's ganged everyone up against me and she—"
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.757454976439476|" Maybe this Marinette girl isn't entirely to blame?"
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.792952179908752|" Uh! Ugh. Okay, it wasn't totally Marinette's fault. She is really mean to me sometimes, but actually, this time, Daddy got angry all by himself."
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.265390276908875|"All by himself?"
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.721694082021713|" Yeah, because… there was something he couldn't do…"

"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|0.0354734659194946|" Mm-hmm."
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.735043406486511|" It— it was me. I hurt my daddy's feelings. Because I want to leave Paris, forever."
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.776907473802567|" Because of what happened in school? I'm sure Marinette probably didn't exactly mean what she said."
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.722661435604095|" Oh, it's not just her— actually, I don't even care about her— it's because I have no reason to be here: nobody likes me; I have no friends. I'm… useless."
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.69894003868103|"A friend once told me: nobody is useless, Chloé."
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|0.0589606761932373|" It's easy for you to say that. You're Ladybug, a superhero. You serve a purpose."
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.37525463104248|" Yes, I can fix up all the messes. You said it yourself in your documentary."
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|0.0937795639038086|"You saw it?!"
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|0.0354734659194946|"Mm-hmm."
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.766182109713554|" Oh! I'm so embarrassed. That film's ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous. I realize that now."
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.448039650917053|" Don't worry Chloé. You can fix your own messes, if that's what you want. You, too, can serve a purpose, but you have to want to."
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|0.479256629943848|"I do want to."

"Malediktator"|"Roger and other guards"|-0.118239402770996|" It's okay, honey. They've got more important things to do. By the power vested in me, I declare that you are my shield. "
"Roger and other guards"|"Ladybug"|-0.462382972240448|" None shall pass, Malediktator."
"Ladybug"|"Queen Bee"|0.470124244689941|" Here's the plan—"
"Queen Bee"|"Audrey"|-0.707520961761475|"Here I am, Daddy! I'm sorry I hurt your feelings the way I did. Stop all this nonsense at once!"
"Audrey"|"Queen Bee"|0.54484224319458|" My honey pie, you look so pretty in that suit!"
"Queen Bee"|"Malediktator"|-0.478365480899811|" Ugh! And please put Mom back to normal. I can't bear to see her like this. Your powers are ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous."
"Malediktator"|"Hawk Moth"|0.621017098426819|"That's enough! Now you're going to do what I tell you to do. By the power vested in me, give me your Miraculous!"

"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.150529980659485|" Well, she did save Paris, so… she just may be able to save herself, too. Am I right?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.434400916099548|" Rena Rouge and Carapace helped Ladybug save Paris, but nobody threw them a party. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.333059668540955|" That's because we don't know their true identities, unlike Chloé. If she feels like she can be useful, I'm sure she'll change her attitude."

"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.230080008506775|"I'm gonna be late again! Quick, Tikki! "
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|0.22601306438446|" Marinette Dupain Cheng? "
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|0.309428334236145|"Present. "
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|-0.354221522808075|" Mylène Haprèle?Mylène?"
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.70214632153511|" She's not here. Officer Roger took her and Ivan home because, they were holding a sit-in and blocking a bulldozer."
"Miss Bustier"|"Alya"|-0.612575769424438|" What? "
"Alya"|"Kim"|-0.292734563350677|"Well, they must have been protesting the city's plan to rehabilitate Place des Vosges."
"Kim"|"Alya"|-0.193497002124786|"What does rehabilitate mean?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.28249180316925|"It says here, Project Oxygen will be a breath of fresh air for Paris."
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|0.000925064086914062|" A breath of fresh air? It's weird that Mylène and Ivan would be against it."
"Miss Bustier"|"Roger"|-0.65385627746582|"Regardless Officer Roger has made a huge mistake. "
"Roger"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.768210619688034|" Miss Bustier, is there a problem with Sabrina?"
"Miss Bustier"|"Roger"|-0.745787113904953|" No, your daughter is fine. However, there is a problem with Ivan and Mylène. They weren't doing anything wrong, were they?"
"Roger"|"Miss Bustier"|0.405607938766479|" Well, it's complicated. I'm escorting them home, just following orders."
"Miss Bustier"|"Alya"|0.567151665687561|" Well, I'm ordering you to bring them back to Place des Vosges. I'm coming to get them.Follow me, children. Today's class will be dedicated to civics education with real-life practical experience. "
"Alya"|"Hessenpy"|-0.222996354103088|"Hey, Ladybloggers! Just because there aren't any supervillains attacking Paris right now doesn't mean there's nothing super going on.We've never seen Miss Bustier so worked up, so get ready to see some action. Stay connected, peeps!"
"Hessenpy"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.19906884431839|" The chainsaw is in good condition.It will be operated only by an adult who has read the instruction manual.Everything's in order, you may proceed. "
"Miss Bustier"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|0.257796764373779|" Mr. Mayor, what are you doing?!"
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Miss Bustier"|0.278380155563354|" I am rehabilitating the Place des Vosges square."
"Miss Bustier"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.642548561096191|" By cutting down a tree?!"
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Roger"|-0.480000376701355|" Yes, but, I- "
"Roger"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.323761999607086|" Shh! Shh! Uhhh, Miss Bustier told me to do it."
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Roger"|0.065038800239563|" Who pays your salary, Roger?!"
"Roger"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|0.169477343559265|" You do, Mr. Mayor. I, I mean, Paris City Hall does."
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.196666300296783|" You obey me! Take those troublemakers right back home!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Roger"|-0.671845674514771|" Roger, don't do this!"
"Roger"|"Mylène"|0.0933729410171509|"Whose orders am I supposed to follow?"
"Mylène"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.576100081205368|" Stop Project Oxygen!"
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Mylène"|-0.673760592937469|" You see? I can't rehabilitate in peace. They're disrupting my ceremony."
"Mylène"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.802392512559891|" That's because your project is unethical and uneco-friendly!"
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Commercial"|-0.658669829368591|" Nonsense! Look here! "
"Commercial"|"Adrien"|0.499651670455933|" Because air is life, the city is teaming up with Paris's most significant investors.To transform pollution into pure fresh air, that will then be sold in unique container designed by fashion mogul, Gabriel Agreste. "
"Adrien"|"Commercial"|0.327963590621948|" Oxygen isn't just a breath of fresh air. It's life itself. "
"Commercial"|"Marinette"|0.455110669136047|" Oxygen! Get a whiff of life. "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.752417683601379|"He is so beautif-Oh, I meant, it… is so beautiful, your commitment… to save the planet."
"Adrien"|"Kim"|0.252292037010193|" Father told me it was an ad for a new cologne."
"Kim"|"Nino"|0.53065812587738|" So that's rehabilitating? It actually looks kinda cool."
"Nino"|"Rose"|-0.322428345680237|" Yeah, what's not ecological about it, Mylène?"
"Rose"|"Mylène"|0.437116026878357|" It's super eco-friendly, it'll de-pollute the air in Paris and make it fresh! "
"Mylène"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.493314206600189|"You're letting yourselves be fooled by pretty pictures shown like that. Project Oxygen seems great, but when you look closer at the details, it just doesn't hold up. In reality, they're cutting downour best natural filters, trees.And replacing them with artificial filters, their tower, and making us pay for all of it.Mr. Mayor, instead of destroying all these trees, wouldn't it be better to build more parks?"
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Chloé"|0.34883987903595|" Well-"
"Chloé"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.637876689434052|"Who cares about a lame ugly tree when you can have a gorgeous designer container from Adrikins' daddy, Gabriel Agreste instead?Besides, there'll be a tree on the label, much prettier than the real thing."
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Chloé"|-0.146788001060486|" And the floor in the tower will be built with recycled wood from the trees we cut down. Very eco-friendly."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.630472153425217|" And real trees have to be watered. Talk about wasting water! "
"Marinette"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.62944284081459|" Mayor Bourgeois, perhaps Mylène and Ivan have misunderstood your project. Do you really want to take away the trees, a natural and cost-free air filter, and replace them with a tower that will absorb polluted air? So that afterwards, you can clean the air and sell it back in plastic bottles. The same bottles which will become trash and pollute our oceans?"
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Alya"|-0.593547314405441|" Yes, that’s it.Uh, I mean, no. Of course not! It’s not that simple. Ecology is complicated, especially for children your age. Leave these things to the adults."
"Alya"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.186277508735657|" So actually, your project is all about cutting down our trees and closing our favorite park. "
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|-0.505063652992249|" And if Mylène and Ivan are trying to stop this, then we are on their side."
"Marinette"|"Mylène"|-0.697430491447449|" It’s true. The Mayor’s solution for fighting pollution is misguided."
"Mylène"|"Marinette"|-0.346751749515533|" Like so many other so-called miracle solutions that are supposed to deal with ecological problems, the thing is there’s never just one simple solution that can fix everything. What we need are lots of small solutions that can tackle the problem all at the same time. That’s why there has to be a lot of us all working together."
"Marinette"|"Mylène"|-0.62433135509491|" Good thing you and Ivan got involved to stop this, but why didn’t you guys tell us about it? The whole class would have come with you. "
"Mylène"|"Marinette"|0.24765157699585|" We did, Marinette.We've been demonstrating against Project Oxygen for the past six months and we did everything we could to get your attention."
"Marinette"|"Rose"|-0.776668980717659|" We're so sorry. We were just so busy doing... I don't know what it was we were doing."
"Rose"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.778542146086693|" We're so lame."
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Mylène"|0.706209182739258|" This is all very touching but I've got a project to launch."
"Mylène"|"Class"|-0.576100081205368|"Stop Project Oxygen! "
"Class"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.450006425380707|" Stop Project Oxygen! Stop Project Oxygen! Stop Project Oxygen!"
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Sabine"|-0.416668474674225|"Come on! Will you just let me rehabilitate in peace!"
"Sabine"|"Fred"|-0.489000737667084|" Tom, isn't that Marinette there?"
"Fred"|"Nora"|-0.256067633628845|"Mylène?"
"Nora"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.256901800632477|" What's this clown up to? Hang on, I'm coming down."
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Roger"|0.346594572067261|" Roger, do something, will you?!"
"Roger"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|0.471433520317078|" To tell you the truth, Mr. Mayor, I've been thinking and it seems like these kids are onto something."
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Tom"|-0.351450443267822|" You're not paid to think, Roger, but to obey!"
"Tom"|"Fred"|-0.636051923036575|" You lost your mind, Mr. Mayor? These are just kids!"
"Fred"|"Nora"|0.634667754173279|" I support my daughter one hundred percent."
"Nora"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.720274358987808|" No one's messing with any trees on my watch!"
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Adrien"|-0.769045665860176|" I'm trying to help you people!Ah, you're all being ridiculous!"
"Adrien"|"Wayhem"|-0.696121364831924|"Sorry, Mayor Bourgeois, but we can't let you do this. "
"Wayhem"|"Nadja"|-0.217369258403778|"Adrien wants to save the trees, we're gonna save the trees! "
"Nadja"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.637854099273682|" Mr. Mayor, it seems everyone is opposed to Project Oxygen, including Adrien Agreste, even though his own father is involved. Are you going to resign?"
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"People in the video"|-0.62499538064003|" Yes, I mean no, I don't know."
"People in the video"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.515637338161469|" Stop Project Oxygen! Stop Project Oxygen! "
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Gabriel"|-0.131136119365692|"Gabriel, it's André. I'm a bit overwhelmed here with our project, I need your help."
"Gabriel"|"Nadja"|-0.638854593038559|" Don't worry, André. I'm sure you'll find a way to change people's minds. When one fights for a good cause, one always finds a solution.And if you don't find a solution, my old friend, destiny will come to your aid. "
"Nadja"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.148382127285004|" Mr. Mayor, it's just been confirmed that citizens are banding together all over Paris to protect the trees. What do you have to say?"
"Shadow Moth"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.0717354416847229|" A powerful man rendered powerless. His plans disappear into thin air. This calls for the strongest of actions.Amok, akuma, go forth and evilize our dear Mayor. "
"Shadow Moth"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.476558208465576|"Malediktator, I am Shadow Moth. They're challenging your authority? Why bother trying to convince them when you can make them change their minds?"
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.20171445608139|" I'd like to, Shadow Moth, but I can't be everywhere and control all my fellow citizens at once."
"Shadow Moth"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|0.585196971893311|" You can't do this alone, but it's only because you're lacking a good deputy. I'm giving you the power to create your own sentimonster to assist you. This will allow you to be everywhere at once and force everyone to agree with you. All I ask in return are Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous. "

"Mylène"|"Marinette"|-0.206525444984436|" There's no shame in being afraid, Marinette. I'm scared, too, of the dark, of humidity, of germs, and even mice! I was really frightened about protesting this morning but I plucked up my courage, and managed to do it anyway. Now we've got to escape and find a way to help the others. If you ever get too scared, just hold this badgeand remember, fear is a natural reflex but you can overcome it."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.585789144039154|"How am I gonna do this? Oh, I know!Oh, no! A Mini-Malediktator! Get away, Mylène!I made up! Help us to de-pollute Paris, my fellow citizens!I know, that wasn't very cool, but I had no choice. Come on, Tikki, we need Ladybug!Spots on! "

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.107051134109497|" The thing is there's no one miracle solution. What we need are lots of small solutions that can all tackle at the same time. That's why there has to be a lot of us working together. And I know who can help us! Buy us some time, Kitty Cat."

"Ladybug"|"Mullo"|0.545920968055725|" Do you realize how many fears you've managed to overcome? The objects that help you get over your fears are just like the Miraculous and you fight everyday to defend a cause without anyone noticing. That's just like having a secret identity.

"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.361561715602875|" You okay?"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.659644246101379|" So, how about that tune? Will you let me hear it?"
"Luka"|"Gabriel"|-0.191632151603699|" Are you sure you really want to hear it? "
"Gabriel"|"Marinette"|0.406547665596008|" It's perfect!As good as new! "
"Nadja"|"Sabrina"|0.137711524963379|"...help them defeat the fearsome Destroyer, Ladybug and Cat Noir..."
"Sabrina"|"Nadja"|-0.605656117200851|"WHOOOH!"
"Nadja"|"Chloé"|0.528885841369629|" ...with the help of their sidekicks: Rena Rouge and Carapace..."
"Chloé"|"Nadja"|0.489339351654053|"Today's the day."
"Nadja"|"Nadja"|-0.116822063922882|" Let's hope the guardians will defeat this villain soon! Stay tuned for updates. "
"Nadja"|"Chloé"|-0.670599550008774|" The battle between our heroes and Destroyer is in full swing!Oh no! And now Paris' most pointed monument is being ravaged by the horrendous supervillain! "
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.764879882335663|" Ugh, how embarrassing. Without me around, they look ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous."
"Sabrina"|"Sabrina"|0.0869169235229492|" Come on, Ladybug! You need help. Come and fetch Chloé!"
"Sabrina"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.0866303443908691|" Ah! Oh yes, sorry uhm... Come and fetch Queen Bee!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Mayura"|-0.582903832197189|" Mayura. Ladybug and Cat Noir are in trouble."
"Mayura"|"Hawk Moth"|0.246883034706116|"Chloé's already waiting for her like she always does."
"Hawk Moth"|"Nadja"|0.695063948631287|" Perfect. Be ready in case Ladybug goes and hands her the Bee Miraculous."
"Nadja"|"Chloé"|0.221941471099854|" Ladybug calls her Lucky Charm and gets... a rubber duck? What is she going to do with that? Will Cat Noir, Rena Rouge, and Carapace...?"
"Chloé"|"Nadja"|0.557928442955017|" Come on! What are you waiting for? You need me!"
"Nadja"|"Chloé"|0.215424418449402|" Okay! Of course! That's brilliant! And Ladybug pulls it off yet again! She defeated Destroyer with the help of all her superhero friends! "
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.580168664455414|" All? ALL!? What about Queen Bee? Ugh! "
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|-0.751678943634033|"That's really not cool."
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.680197477340698|" Oh, you so don't get it. Ladybug only calls on me when she has serious villains to contend with."
"Sabrina"|"Carapace"|0.175205945968628|" Uhh, yeah! Of course."
"Carapace"|"Rena Rouge"|-0.700037032365799|" Wayzz, shell off."
"Rena Rouge"|"Ladybug"|0.0189802646636963|" Trixx, let's rest."
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|-0.18496161699295|"And don't forget. Nobody can ever know our secret identities."
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|-0.565151989459991|" Except us, of course."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.764467358589172|"Thank you, see you next time. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.368671774864197|" Still haven't spoken to her, huh?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.147587180137634|" You know how dangerous it is to use Chloé. Everybody knows that she was Queen Bee, everyone including Hawk Moth. He can use it to trap us. That's why our identities must remain a secret."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.163617372512817|" And the best kept secrets are the ones you don't share, yeah-yeah, I know. I don't think Chloé knows that her time as Queen Bee is over, though."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.355316579341888|" I know, I just haven't time to tell her and......and I won't today either, I'm about to transform back! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.654589772224426|" M'lady... promise me you'll go talk to her. It's the right thing to do."
"Ladybug"|"Gabriel"|0.478041410446167|" Yeah, sure. "
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.172393321990967|" Chloé Bourgeois must become Queen Bee again!"
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.102484405040741|" Are you still considering making her an ally? I'm afraid Ladybug has grown reluctant to giving Chloé the Bee Miraculous. She's being very careful."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.000634431838989258|" Then I will get Chloé to force Ladybug to give it to her. All I need is for her to lose all hope in Ladybug. To become angry enough so I can akumatize her. "
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.467665672302246|"Maybe it's time we bring Lila Rossi's psychological talent into the plan."
"Gabriel"|"Lila"|0.65911066532135|" Excellent idea, Nathalie..."
"Lila"|"Gabriel"|-0.303100764751434|" I really want to thank you for trusting me, Mr. Agreste. I'm very honored to be able to protect Adrien. But I'm saddened by all the people around him. Your son deserves better than that friend of his Nino. Not to mention all the girls clamoring to catch his eye, especially that Marinette dummy and that stuck-up Chloé. Chloé! Pfft! She won't stop bragging about being Queen Bee, but Adrien couldn't care less about these girls. He's just so perfect."
"Gabriel"|"Lila"|-0.581071645021439|" I don't think Adrien's completely indifferent to Chloé. They've had a very strong friendship ever since they were young - a relationship that no one can ruin. Thank you, Lila. I'll see you tomorrow. "
"Lila"|"Gabriel"|0.580018281936646|" Yes. See you tomorrow."
"Gabriel"|"Chloé"|0.659477949142456|" I'm sure that this young lady will help us implement our grand plan."
"Chloé"|"Lila"|-0.719575762748718|" Rena Rouge and Carapace are so tacky. I just don’t understand why Ladybug keeps calling on them and when I, Queen Bee-"
"Lila"|"Adrien, Nino, and Alya"|0.745601534843445|" Good morning, everyone!"
"Adrien, Nino, and Alya"|"Marinette"|0.363491415977478|" Hey, Lila! "
"Marinette"|"Nino"|0.671260714530945|"Yeah, let's go study for that test. "
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.0837932825088501|" What test?"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|0.575425982475281|" The science test this afternoon."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Adrien"|"Lila"|0.550670742988586|" Come on. I'll get ya up to speed. "
"Lila"|"Chloé"|-0.393020153045654|"Were you talking about Ladybug?"
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.348347425460815|" Uhh... who are you again?"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|0.187278866767883|" That’s Lila. She’s in our class!"
"Chloé"|"Lila"|-0.657396346330643|" Really? Well, she clearly didn't make a big impression on me."
"Lila"|"Chloé"|0.550413489341736|"Oh, I love your sense of humor. I remember now that Ladybug mentioned it a few times."
"Chloé"|"Lila"|0.0712987184524536|" You talk to Ladybug?"
"Lila"|"Chloé"|0.790292501449585|" Of course! She and I are very close friends. A bit like you used to be back in the day! Whenever I feel like seeing her, I've got a magic command that calls her to me right away."
"Chloé"|"Lila"|0.439103603363037|" Magic?"
"Lila"|"Chloé"|0.389448046684265|" Yeah, just like your signal to summon her, except mine works every time."
"Chloé"|"Lila"|0.5463045835495|"Well, to each her own. "
"Lila"|"Chloé"|-0.612755239009857|" Don't you want to know what it is?"
"Chloé"|"Lila"|0.142391443252563|"If you insist."
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.516255140304565|" If Ladybug doesn't come to you with that, then you'll know she's not a true friend. "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.685716152191162|"Go ahead, I'll meet you."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.436493813991547|" Chloé?"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.412548899650574|" What do you want, Dupain-Cheng?"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.106205224990845|" I don't know what Lila just told you but, you should watch out for her, besides I'm sure Ladybug will come and see you anyway with or without magic."
"Chloé"|" Marinette"|-0.654736369848251|" You making fun of me right now?"
" Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.599772870540619|" No, No! I'm not!"
"Chloé"|"Tikki"|-0.145085275173187|" I could see Ladybug WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE IT, OKAY, so mind your own business DUPAIN-CHENG."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.180477499961853|" You really got to talk to Chloé."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.471705257892609|" But I just did. It’s pointless, obviously."
"Tikki"|"Marinete"|-0.161098837852478|" No! Marinette talked to Chloé! You know the only person Chloé listens to is Ladybug. "
"Marinete"|"Hawk Moth"|0.344954013824463|"You’re right."
"Hawk Moth"|"Mayura"|0.119358062744141|" Our ally is living up to our expectations. I can already feel Chloé's anger rising. Get ready, Mayura."
"Mayura"|"Marinette"|-0.387271881103516|" Yes, Hawk Moth."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.580251812934875|" It's time."
"Marinette"|"August"|-0.203119039535522|" Tikki, spots on! Yeah!"
"August"|"August's mother"|-0.476714491844177|" Lollipop! Lollipop!"
"August's mother"|"August"|-0.567618876695633|" No August, I've told you already. You’re too little to have lollipops."
"August"|"Mayura"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Mayura"|"Ladybug"|-0.463360190391541|"Fly away beautiful Amok. Enhance and hone that frustration. "
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.594862043857574|" A sentimonster! Sorry, Chloé, you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer. "
"Chloé"|"Butler Jean"|0.489339351654053|"Today's the day! "
"Butler Jean"|"Chloé"|0.596331834793091|"Welcome, ma—"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|-0.494641065597534|" Move, Jean-Gasphard! "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.0588282346725464|" Thank you, I'll be safe now. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.165851235389709|" You're right. It's nice and safe in here! How about we just hang and wait for a Camembert monster instead?"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.496951103210449|" If we end up running into one, I promise I'll save you a big chunk. Come on!"
"Adrien"|"Cat Noir"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.666986256837845|" Look out, M’lady! Lollipops are bad for your teeth."
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.638157725334167|" I don't see an akumatized person anywhere! Seem like this sentimonster is all on it's own. "
"Chloé"|"Nadja"|0.307952642440796|" Come on! Hurry!"
"Nadja"|"Sabrina"|-0.544523447751999|"Don't be bemused, it's just the news! The battle between Ladybug and the lollipop monster has begun!"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|0.469472885131836|" You know, if Ladybug doesn't show up, I could go fetch our costumes and we could play dress up."
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|0.439640641212463|" That's right, go fetch the costumes."
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|0.645156860351562|" Yay! "
"Chloé"|"Lila"|0.19414484500885|" Come on!"
"Lila"|"Chloé"|0.635969400405884|"I've got a magic command that calls her to me right away. Don't you want to know what it is?"
"Chloé"|"Butler Jean"|-0.603188425302505|" No! That would be ridiculous, utterly ri-Ladybug, Ladybug, Ladybug. "
"Butler Jean"|"Chloé"|-0.729844301939011|" Mademoiselle seemed a little upset eariler. "
"Chloé"|"Butler Jean"|-0.331852793693542|"Get... lost, Jean Pascal!"
"Butler Jean"|"Ladybug"|-0.259672999382019|"Mademoiselle needs a few minutes to herself."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.651384979486465|" Gotcha! Bye bye, little feather."
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|0.223827004432678|"Miraculous Ladybug!"
"Chloé"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.387053787708282|" But... I did the magic dance! Ladybug wouldn't have forgotten all about me!That smart aleck idiot at school took me for a ride! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Sabrina"|-0.460100829601288|" Yes... I feel the anger rising, my plan is rolling out beautifully.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize her! "
"Sabrina"|"Chloe"|-0.526673674583435|"That's okay. We can still play Ladybug and Cat Noir! "
"Chloe"|"Sabrina"|-0.447893738746643|" PLAY? With you!? Who are YOU anyway? You don't have any powers! You're a nobody! I'm a superheroine, okay? I'm Queen Bee! You and I have NOTHING in common! Go away!"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Chloé"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.596032112836838|" No, Hawk Moth! I am a superheroine! I am Queen Bee! Ladybug will come and get me when she needs me! I WILL NEVER JOIN YOU! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Sabrina"|0.265554070472717|"Chloé Bourgeois is really quite... unique. But I can feel a negative emotion not far from her. A friend who could help us achieve our goal. Follow it, my evil akuma!"
"Sabrina"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.481036424636841|"Stop tickling me!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Sabrina"|-0.246200203895569|"Miraculer, your friend has rejected you because she is only interested in other people's powers. Well, I'm giving you the power to steal those powers from them, and win back your friendship. And in return, you will bring me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous."
"Sabrina"|"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|0.632266044616699|" Thank you, Hawk Moth. Chloé and I will be a real team at last! "
"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it!"
"Cat Noir"|"Miraculer"|-0.75497280061245|" Hey, you're a tad on the late side. The fight was five minutes ago."
"Miraculer"|"Cat Noir"|-0.755499467253685|"The fight was five minutes ago. Actually, it's right now!You've neglected Chloé one time too many, Ladybug!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.713610798120499|"I guess you didn't work things out with her, did you?"
"Ladybug"|"Miraculer"|-0.482433140277863|" I was about to, but..."
"Miraculer"|"Ladybug"|-0.722950965166092|"I was about to, but... Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!"
"Ladybug"|"Miraculer"|-0.0258530974388123|"Cat Noir, I'm gonna transform back at any second."
"Miraculer"|"Ladybug"|-0.484861969947815|"Oh, help me, Cat Noir!"
"Ladybug"|"Miraculer"|-0.702885061502457|" I don't even talk like that! Stop mimicking me! "
"Miraculer"|"Ladybug"|0.658301115036011|" Lucky Charm! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.206269085407257|" What have you done?"
"Cat Noir"|"Miraculer"|-0.355262815952301|" She's swiped your power! That little copycat! Get backup, I'll take care of her. Cataclysm!"
"Miraculer"|"Hawk Moth"|0.572007894515991|" What's the phrase again? Oh! Cataclysm!Oh, Chloé's gonna love our powers!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Cat Noir"|0.327038049697876|"I'm sure you're right, Miraculer. Run and find her now."
"Cat Noir"|"Plagg"|-0.36727648973465|" Plagg, claws in. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.673475712537766|" So, that's what it feels like to get Cataclysmed. I promise I'll never call the dinosaurs a bunch of wusses ever again."
"Adrien"|"Master Fu"|-0.0149392485618591|" Plagg, grab some Camembert in my jacket. We'll rest for a while 'til Ladybug comes back."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.60442316532135|" Marinette Dupain-Cheng, you must pick an ally you can trust to fight along side you on this mission. Once the mission is over, you will get the Miraculous back and return them to me. "
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.14951080083847|" Miraculer has stolen both of our powers. We're going to need everyone."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.381197333335876|" Even... Chloé?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.688665390014648|"This akumatized person is her best friend. If anyone can help us, it's Chloé."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.194805204868317|" You sure?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.542141199111938|" This might be her last mission, but we definitely need her this time. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.492063999176025|" Cat Noir, are you okay?"

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0297011137008667|" I promise you we'll get our powers back, Cat Noir. And I'll heal you."

"Nadja"|"Miraculer"|-0.342275559902191|"We still don't know how Ladybug and Cat Noir are doing after their latest battle."
"Miraculer"|"Chloé"|0.665088295936584|"Chloé! I have powers now! We can play together again! "

"Chloé"|"Cat Noir"|-0.609762340784073|" Not like this! You are so far off the mark! I don't wanna be Ladybug, there's only one Ladybug, and she isn't me. I am-"

"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.449730336666107|"Sabrina! I've changed my mind. I do want Ladybug's powers. They should've gotten me sooner, but since they chose not to, I've decided I'd rather play with you instead."

"Queen Bee"|"Ladybug"|-0.546506524085999|" If you'd given it to me earlier, we'd probably would've defeated Hawk Moth. "
"Ladybug"|"Queen Bee"|-0.606379479169846|" I'm sorry, Chloé. I should've told you this a long time ago. I might never be able to let you be Queen Bee again."
"Queen Bee"|"Ladybug"|-0.281600832939148|" What? But I did everything you asked me to."
"Ladybug"|"Queen Bee"|-0.508735984563828|" I know. But this is for your own safety. It's too dangerous for you and your loved ones because Hawk Moth knows that you're Queen Bee."
"Queen Bee"|"Chloé"|-0.754443347454071|" Buzz off. "
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.0371677875518799|" I understand. But I'm sure that you'll need me again, Ladybug. I know that I'll be Queen Bee again someday. I will always be Queen Bee."

"Hawk Moth"|"Chloé"|-0.601490765810013|" No, Mayura. We've set the stage for the future. Queen Bee will change her mind."
"Chloé"|"Lila"|0.0978981256484985|" Hey, you!"
"Lila"|"Chloé"|-0.436493813991547|" Chloé!"
"Chloé"|"Lila"|-0.216546714305878|" That magic code you told me to call Ladybug? It was just a big joke, wasn't it?"
"Lila"|"Chloé"|-0.592177897691727|" Of course it wasn't. Why? Weren't you with Ladybug yesterday?"
"Chloé"|"Lila"|-0.428332626819611|" Uh... yes?"
"Lila"|"Chloé"|0.423746943473816|" So it worked then."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.528254866600037|" Uh... yes? Okay, fine! You're not completely useless! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.73834228515625|" I hope I didn't hurt Chloé's feelings too much. She's worked so hard."
"Tikki"|"Nadja"|0.559321641921997|" It's for her own good. And you're also protecting Ladybug and Cat Noir by doing that. That's what being a superheroine is all about."
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.654746294021606|" Sure, it's amazing being Ladybug. I've got these powers, kwamis, but can you imagine I could've prevented Shadow Moth from creating villains in the first place? Ha! He'd be ruined! Have you noticed that Shadow Moth seems to reakumatize people much more often these days? Do you know why? Because he gets to know them and figures out how to manipulate them better!"
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.485144913196564|" You're right. I was akumatized four times as Lady Wifi because I was obsessed with with you! I knew you were hiding something from me and it drove me crazy."
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.171819567680359|" I had to keep it a secret."
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.120787501335144|" I know girl. But now that I know the truth, I've got your back!What? Mr. Pigeon has already been akumatized 71 times?!"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.496701836585999|" He's just a harmless guy trying to take care of his pigeons. It's so not fair! I'd promised him I'd find a way to keep him safe from Shadow Moth, but I just can't figure it out.I don't understand a thing in this spell book!"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.0198296904563904|" Oh! Hold that thought Wayzz, I think this is it! "
"Ladybug"|"Trixx"|-0.593341797590256|" Ugh, I was sure that \"spicy little rock\" would be pepper."
"Trixx"|"Alya"|-0.48838084936142|" Alya, help us reason with her, please!"
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.540255308151245|" Marinette, how long have you been working on this? "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.648551344871521|" I dunno, six-seven days, maybe ten. Now that we're on spring break, I finally have time to put my whole heart into it!"
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.298582673072815|" When was the last time you worked on one of your own designs? "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.252492666244507|" I do loads of designing! Look!I designed a security system so that nobody can enter my room when I'm not in it. And if I put on this hatI hear everything that's going on in here, even when I'm out of the room."
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.30516129732132|" I'm gonna have to break it to you because I'm the only one who can.THIS IS TOTALLY INSANE! Girl, trust your BFF. When I'm researching something obsessively and I can't think of anything else, that's when my mind can get really blocked. You know what you need most right now? A break! "
"Ladybug"|"Sabine"|-0.642597228288651|" No way! No breaks until I find out how to keep Shadow Moth from reakumatizing people! "
"Sabine"|"Tom"|-0.352557480335236|" Tom, this science experiment is starting to worry me. "
"Tom"|"Alya"|-0.604955762624741|" But you know that she asked us not to bother her."
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.236639261245728|" I get that you wanna see the end of Shadow Moth but you know what my grandmother always says? \"Life is not waiting for the storm to pass, it's learning to dance in the rain.\""
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.399874210357666|" Dance? But Alya, how can I dance when I know Shadow Moth's going after the people I love?!"
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.524338126182556|" I bet you had no idea Adrien and Kagami aren't seeing each other anymore. "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.772241801023483|"What?! Are you serious?!I have to go and console Kagami!Poor thing, she must be devastated! "
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.453471779823303|" Hang on, don't you mean you have to go and console Adrien? "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.579413831233978|" Why would I console Adrien?"
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.104230999946594|" The house-and-three-kids-and-a-hamster-named-whatever and all that. Does that ring a bell?"
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.65777513384819|" There's no way we could be together anyway, I can't even talk to him! And besides... I have... no more feelings for Adrien... I don't love him anymore, there! And Kagami is perfect for him. I mean she has no problem talking to him. And they fence together.Poor girl, she must be so upset."
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.573974221944809|" This is a joke right? Or maybe all those days locked in your room, breathing magical fumes must have gone to your brain? "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.652782678604126|" Alya, Kagami doesn't have any friends in Paris besides me. I have to go and console her."
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.227453947067261|" Fine! Go console Kagami if you want to. As long as you're outside, getting some fresh air and thinking about something else it's all good. Meanwhile I'm gonna go through all these notes and see if I can make any sense out of it."
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.028968334197998|" Huh! You would do that? "
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.285374343395233|" You're not alone anymore, Marinette. I've got your back, remember? "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.433954477310181|"Thanks, Alya."
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.793099582195282|"Forgetting something? "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.679266154766083|"Oops, spots off. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.544427394866943|" Aren't you still forgetting something? "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.120954692363739|" Why? No.Of course! My pool bag! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.712198793888092|" Uh, Marinette... "
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|-0.18024218082428|"Oh! My pajamas! "
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.617804765701294|"Ah, sweetie! That science project of yours is finally done? "
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.531710118055344|" Yes I-I mean, no, but Alya's helping me so I'm gonna take a break. "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.112750589847565|"Maybe you should take something to eat on the road. "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.432349801063538|"Thanks, Dad! "
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.0810426473617554|"Now let's go cheer up Kagami!"
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|0.0623084306716919|"Hello? "
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.350549697875977|"Kagami! Where are you? "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.257667601108551|" In the Tuileries Garden."
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.383329272270203|" Perfect! Don't move. I'm on my way!"
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.506499290466309|" Actually now is not a good time to- "
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.701783776283264|" I'll always be there for you Kagami.Kagami!!! Ooh! Would you like a brioche, Mrs. Tsurugi? "
"Kagami"|"Tomoe"|0.184712171554565|" Mother, you remember Marinette? "
"Tomoe"|"Marinette"|0.599680662155151|"Yes, I distinctly remember your very... unique friend. "
"Marinette"|"Tomoe"|0.654600262641907|" I'll bring your daughter back in an hour. Oh! Try those brioches stuffed with fresh fruit. It's one of my dad's new recipes! They're delish! "
"Tomoe"|"Marinette"|0.345965266227722|" Mmm."
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.372322201728821|" Adrien is at the pool, getting ready to shoot his next big ad campaign! It's the perfect place for the two of you to make up!"
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|0.218833684921265|" You know Adrien's schedule by heart?"
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.0780124664306641|" Yeah for the next three years duh! But who cares? 'Cause today's the day that I'm getting you two back together. "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.733034312725067|" I don't want to get back together with Adrien. I was the one who decided to break up and-"
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.297986388206482|" Of course you did! You felt that somehow you weren't worthy of him, but you're wrong Kagami. You're strong, you're perfect! He's perfect! "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.456511497497559|" You're meant for each other! Right now I get it, it's out of sight, out of mind. But the second you lay eyes on him again, you'll both blush and stutter, talk nonsense about big houses, three kids and a hamster and everything will be wonderful!Sorry. Hello? "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.758821353316307|" Marinette, I don't want to be with Adrien anymore. He let me down. "
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.540941476821899|" Just trust me! I can prove that he's worthy of you! Of course, makes sense. They've closed the pool to rehearse the commercial in private."
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|0.749187588691711|" Perfect. Let's go. "
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.0836416482925415|" Absolutely! Let's go... inside! By distracting the bodyguard."
"Plagg"|"Bob Roth"|-0.0358588695526123|" I'm gonna have to break it to ya 'cause I'm the only one who can.This is totally insane!!Jumping into freezing water first thing in the morning when we could be peacefully eating cheese?I take back everything I said! Everything is great! Just great!"
"Bob Roth"|"Gabriel"|0.621816873550415|" Okay, now picture it Gabe. Adrien is on top of the Eiffel Tower, bathed in sunlight. He jumps off, slow motion. Doves flutter all around him as if his fall would never end. The catchphrase, \"dive into romantic, magical, eternal Paris!\" And then splash! Right into a giant glass of sparkling golden juice! Backshot! \"Splash, the new fragrance by Gabriel.\""
"Gabriel"|"Bob Roth"|-0.701825797557831|"Those birds are not doves, they're pigeons. "
"Bob Roth"|"Mr. Ramier"|-0.604296684265137|" Not at all! They're doves! "
"Mr. Ramier"|"Bob Roth"|-0.725637882947922|" My birds aren't do-"
"Bob Roth"|"Gabriel"|0.402461051940918|" Listen Ramier, I know those are pigeons but it is in both of our best interests if Agreste believes they're doves! Mine, because he's paying me a lot of money. And yours, because I can convince the mayor to create a space specifically dedicated to pigeons in Paris. So, for today, your pigeons are doves! Got it? Okay everybody, places! Action!"
"Gabriel"|"Marinette"|-0.614252775907516|" Something... is missing."
"Marinette"|"Wayhem"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Wayhem"|"Gabriel"|-0.186192572116852|" Adrien's at the pool! There!"
"Gabriel"|"Mr. Ramier"|0.570252180099487|" We've got \"magical Paris\" and \"eternal Paris\" but we're missing \"romantic Paris.\" A red rose! I want one of these doves to bring a rose in mid-flight to my son. He'll take it between his teeth before he enters the water. Then it will be perfect!"
"Mr. Ramier"|"Bob Roth"|0.32037079334259|" You can count on Edgar! No animal's more obedient than this sweet little pigeon."
"Bob Roth"|"Adrien"|-0.115819096565247|" Dove! They're doves!"
"Adrien"|"Bob Roth"|-0.661218404769897|" Hang on, I'm allergic to pigeons. If they get too close-"
"Bob Roth"|"Gabriel"|-0.691875696182251|" Nothing is gonna happen because they're doves!"
"Gabriel"|"Bob Roth"|0.102204918861389|" I'll give you thirty minutes to set this all up. "
"Bob Roth"|"Marinette"|-0.694827228784561|" You heard the man, Ramier. You better not let me down!"
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.423738360404968|" And now, time for camouflage! "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|0.577685356140137|" Do you always carry these things with you? "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.303890526294708|" Of course! I have to be rea- I mean you have to be ready for any opportunity whenever you run into Adrien. Everything is retractable and folds up neatly. Even this fancy ball gown. You'll be needing it when you get back together with Adrien.Here are the swimsuits! No time to lose! "
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|-0.00530338287353516|"I bet you're already starting to fall in love with him again. "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.586760878562927|" No."
"Marinette"|"Bob Roth"|-0.583035200834274|" That's just 'cause you haven't seen him in action yet."
"Bob Roth"|"Adrien"|0.391091346740723|" Action!"
"Adrien"|"Bob Roth"|-0.419848680496216|" Aah! "
"Bob Roth"|"Mr. Ramier"|-0.725112020969391|" Your pigeon isn't up for the job! He's not supposed to come back with the rose!"
"Mr. Ramier"|"Adrien"|-0.736298412084579|" The sneeze frightened him."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.600484788417816|" I told you, I'm allergic to pigeons! "
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|0.607901215553284|" Did you see how handsome he is? Did you feel your heart beat faster? Did you get the shivers? Tingles in your fingers? "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.664616197347641|" What I felt was sorry for that poor pigeon tamer."
"Marinette"|"Bob Roth"|-0.496013522148132|" It's because you haven't looked into each others' eyes yet! Oh! I've got an idea!"
"Bob Roth"|"Kagami"|-0.336991488933563|" Here, for your allergy to the doves. "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.698612660169601|" What are you doing? Put me down right now!"
"Marinette"|"Bob Roth"|0.371467471122742|" I'm having your eyes meet. There, he's looking at you. Look at him! Look at him!"
"Bob Roth"|"Adrien"|-0.336827754974365|" This cannot be happening. How complicated is to deliver a rose in mid-flight to a model in mid-dive?"
"Adrien"|"Bob Roth"|-0.601472437381744|" It's my fault. I thought, I saw one of my friends from school. "
"Bob Roth"|"Marinette"|-0.739378720521927|" Well, I don't see anyone, except a stupid bird that's incapable of doing what it's been asked to do and that's gonna be get banned from all of Paris, if it continues to ruin the rehearsals for my commercial! "
"Marinette"|"Kagami"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.660096049308777|" No Marinette, I didn't feel anything, except for shame for me, for Adrien and for this ridiculously embarrassing situation. I'm leaving."
"Marinette"|"Gabriel"|-0.704107820987701|" But, it's because you were too far apart. When you're close together, that you really feel it. Oh, I got an idea!"
"Gabriel"|"Bob Roth"|0.597062587738037|"Are you ready?"
"Bob Roth"|"Mr. Ramier"|0.511785745620728|" Of course! "
"Mr. Ramier"|"Bob Roth"|0.487059116363525|"Remember Edgar, if Mr. Roth is happy he will have a word with the mayor and pigeons will live in Paris happily ever after."
"Bob Roth"|"Kagami"|0.391091346740723|" Action!"
"Kagami"|"Marinette"|-0.327497720718384|" Marinette, stop it! This is completely crazy!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.340242743492126|" Love is crazy! So, stop thinking too much and dive in!"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.565632879734039|" Marinette, what on earth are you doing here?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.0627059936523438|" Me? Well um- I just came here to do a few laps and wind you up- I mean, unwind... How about you?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.635574012994766|" Well, we're in rehearsal for a commercial. The pool is supposed to be closed."
"Marinette"|"Gabriel"|-0.727401167154312|" To the post? Oh well, that's why there was no one at the front desk. Oh boy, I wouldn't want to kiss you- I mean, keep you, keep you from your job. So I'll be on my way. "
"Gabriel"|"Bob Roth"|-0.755011647939682|"This is a complete failure, Robert!"
"Bob Roth"|"Mr. Ramier"|-0.706358671188354|" It's not my fault, it's his fault!"
"Mr. Ramier"|"Gabriel"|0.0817590951919556|"How dare you?! Edgar is my best friend the most intelligent and loyal pigeon there ever was!"
"Gabriel"|"Bob Roth"|0.230680227279663|"So, it is a pigeon!"
"Bob Roth"|"Gabriel"|-0.668085247278214|" What?! This is a pigeon?! Ramier, how dare you cheat me out of the real thing?! So sorry, Gabriel, I'm gonna find a replacement immediately! I know a very good shark trainer!"
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|-0.440445601940155|"Do not disappoint me again. "
"Gabriel"|"Bob Roth"|-0.362487614154816|" This commercial is turning into a fiasco, but maybe we can salvage something beneficial from it after all, my love. "
"Bob Roth"|"Mr. Ramier"|-0.722999006509781|"You get out of my pool! You're fired!"
"Mr. Ramier"|"Bob Roth"|-0.487127006053925|" But you were supposed to have a word with the mayor!"

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.627591729164124|" Ready when you are, LB."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.622238278388977|"Let's go!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.178829491138458|" So that's where Mr. Pigeon's keeping the park keepers he abducted."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.483315825462341|" The Grand Palais.My pigeon radar is on high alert."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.605870723724365|" Either your radar is on the brink or Mr. Pigeon's left the park keepers unattended."

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.389235436916351|" If we can destroy that bird call, we'll be able to capture the akuma. Okay, you open the window, I'll grab him and yank him up onto the roof, then you snag his bird call away from him."

"Alya"|"Nathalie"|0.482315897941589|" Where is that girl?"
"Nathalie"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.391936659812927|" Hello, Mr. Damocles, I am Mr. Agreste's executive assistant Nathalie."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Gabriel"|-0.422471463680267|" Hello, miss. Pardon me, but where is Mr. Agreste? "
"Gabriel"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.613388538360596|"I'm here."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Gabriel"|0.0721985101699829|"Ah, uh, hello Mr. Agreste. Welcome to our school."
"Gabriel"|"Chloé"|0.256046056747437|"Adrien, take Nathalie around."
"Chloé"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.0702453851699829|" Ah, there's Mr. Agreste! He's coming this way. "
"Mr. Damocles"|"Alya"|0.451688766479492|" As you'll see, Mr. Agreste, our students have poured their hearts and souls into their projects. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.484258770942688|" Where have you been?! You got your hat?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.368071675300598|" Yep, here. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.612575769424438|" What? "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.332232713699341|" But, it's the same as Chloé's."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.612575769424438|" What?! "
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.147987604141235|" Uh, hi Mr. Agreste. I'm Chloé Bourgeois. You know my father, André Bourgeois, the mayor?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.68994927406311|" Ugh, that thieving little brat!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.556888699531555|" Do you want me to take care of it?"
"Marinette"|"Gabriel"|0.163959503173828|" I think I can handle this. "
"Gabriel"|"Chloé"|-0.34444785118103|" Hm, turn the tablet back to Ms. Bourgeois' hat.Is this a joke?"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.758952528238297|" No fair! Marinette copied my design! It's scandalous, how could you do that? "
"Marinette"|"Gabriel"|-0.35613739490509|" I apologize for the situation Mr. Agreste, but I can prove that this derby hat is MY original design."
"Gabriel"|"Marinette"|0.57536506652832|" Go ahead."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.464019894599915|" Um, everything on my derby hat is hand-made from the embroidery, to the weaving of the band, to the stitching of the brim.All done by myself. And last, there's a special design element that only the true designer knows about: I signed mine. "
"Chloé"|"Gabriel"|-0.0828880071640015|" Daddy!"
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.595977663993835|" Very exquisite creation. You definitely have the laboring hands of a hat maker, miss..."

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.688606411218643|" What happened? "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.587292939424515|" —Ah!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.478250741958618|" Who are you? "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.635388523340225|" I'm, uh, I—I don't know,I—I don't remember my own name!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.544419050216675|"Me neither.Looks like you and I were at the same costume party. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.330583214759827|" Hm? Why is that flashing?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.504185676574707|" And your earrings, too. We must shop at the same jewelry store."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.272566914558411|" Are we supposed to know each other?"
"Cat Noir"|"Adrien"|-0.638984680175781|" I'd be surprised if we weren't. "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.372877240180969|" Woah."
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.712889403104782|" Ahh!There are giant bugs! Mice?Bug-mice!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.0540868043899536|" Woah, I am starving right now."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.559038162231445|"Hi there!What are you exactly? Genies, like the one in the lamp? "
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|0.474788784980774|" If I'm a genie, where's my lamp? Besides, where am I? And who are you?!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.292923331260681|"What's that thing doing in my earring?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.551628619432449|" I'm not a thing, I'm…I don't know what I am!But I do know that I'm very hungry. "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.717092007398605|"Aw, poor little… no thing! "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.259618937969208|"Okay everyone we're gonna keep our cool here. We've all lost our memories and we don't know why but we'll find— "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.642878234386444|" What is it this time?We can't stay here."
"Adrien"|"Tikki"|0.289722084999084|" Couldn't agree more. "
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|0.338846206665039|" Perhaps we should help them?"
"Plagg"|"Plagg"|0.395979404449463|" Well, I'm not going anywhere until I know what smells so good in that boy's shirt. "
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|0.117694020271301|" We seem to be exceptional beings, unlike them."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.612814664840698|" Thank you!"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.639387458562851|" Let's get out of here!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.772057563066483|" Ah, the exit is blocked."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.564267098903656|"We’re gonna have to find another way out.Fast!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.368683218955994|" Over there! "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.587292939424515|" Ah!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.400184631347656|" Okay. We’re stuck in the building with amnesia being chased by a—a thing that's obviously got it in for us big time."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.654583930969238|" Not to mention the two strange creatures who magically appeared when our costumes disappeared. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.120068371295929|" Uh, excuse me, but the creatures are hungry. Would you mind opening up your shirt to see what smells so good?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.587765157222748|"Camembert?"
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|0.639277577400208|"It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen... "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.646352529525757|" Will this do?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.439049363136292|" Mm!Thank you!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.245351791381836|"Marinette! My name is Marinette Dupain-Cheng!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.758107542991638|"Pleased to meet you, Marinette.Adrien Agreste."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.703870058059692|" Super nice to meet you too, Adrien.Of course!We still got our phones!"
"Adrien"|"Both"|0.696824789047241|"Brilliant!"
"Both"|"Marinette"|-0.289421319961548|"Aw…"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.332267284393311|" Is yours locked too?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.593971490859985|"The thing's coming this way!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.428165912628174|" We need to find a way out of this building!"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.502358794212341|" And we will. Until then…"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.102053880691528|" What do we do—?"
"Marinette"|"Villain"|-0.665076166391373|" Shh! "
"Villain"|"Adrien"|-0.201258897781372|" Uhg! We will get you."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.0958054065704346|" Wow, Marinette! You seem like someone who always has the right idea at the right time!"
"Marinette"|"Both"|0.41994833946228|" I hope you're right. "
"Both"|"Adrien"|-0.705429941415787|" Ah! Sorry. "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.729302883148193|" Okay. I suggest we go upstairs."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.637445360422134|"But there's no way up there. We're gonna get trapped again!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.14343798160553|" We can hide out here while we signal for help. "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.709652155637741|" Good idea!Ugh! No handle! And the glass is tinted.They won't be able to see us."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.237956523895264|"Phone lines are down.If only I could remember how to unlock my phone. "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.131323277950287|" Wait! "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.446746826171875|" Nice work, Marinette!Uh oh. But, who should we call?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.693716078996658|"I'm almost out of battery."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.0711909532546997|"Me too. We should call our parents first.Gabriel Agreste. Probably… my dad. "
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.277003049850464|"This is Gabriel Agreste's voicemail. To leave a message, please call my secretary. "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.350550651550293|"Let's hope you have better luck than me."
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.111370921134949|"Agreste, Césaire, Couffaine, Dupain-Cheng, Sabine! "
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.361783146858215|"Marinette, are you okay? They're saying on TV that Ladybug and Cat Noir are battling a supervillain at the Montparnasse Tower!Isn't that where you were going on your school trip today?"
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.0189281702041626|"Cat Noir and... Ladybug..?"
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.155788600444794|" Marinette, is everything okay? Where are you?"
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.0296916961669922|" Uh, sure, Mom, everything's okay. I'm with my friend, safe. Don't worry."
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.610834449529648|" I'm so relieved! Whatever you do, stay there until the supervillain's been defeated. "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.682994961738586|" Sure, Mom, I will. Love you! "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.0414543151855469|" Why didn't you ask her for help?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.591922968626022|"I have both good news and bad news. The good news is: there are superheroes in the tower that will stop that supervillain. The bad news is: we're the superheroes! And the thing that's chasing us is the supervillain! And we're supposed to be defeating it with superpowers we no longer have! "
"Adrien"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.565250426530838|"Eh..."
"Hawk Moth"|"Marinette"|-0.558432370424271|" Nobody? We must have missed something.They have to be inside the building, Oblivio. Ladybug and Cat Noir can't have escaped. Retrace your steps. They must have transformed back by now. And with their memories erased, you won't have any trouble getting your hands on their Miraculous."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.425398349761963|" If my own mother doesn't know that I'm Ladybug, then nobody must know. "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.475585341453552|" What about us? Do you think… we know?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.0798161029815674|" Hm.I feel like we're more than just a superhero team. "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.102479696273804|"Do you think we're… "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.398019433021545|" Looks like it. "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.376363396644592|" Then we must have told each other everything. I couldn't hide my identity from the girl I love. "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.272541642189026|" So, if we're the superheroes, then what are they? "
"Adrien"|"Tikki"|-0.528170168399811|" I have no idea."
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|-0.668189108371735|" You can't just leave, we have to help them!"
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|-0.691794842481613|" We don't even know who we are, or who they are. I don't want to help out a couple of strangers. "
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|-0.703567624092102|" You may not remember who you are, but at least you know this about this about yourself: you're a selfish being, and a total coward! "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.674877792596817|" Me, a coward?I am not a coward! I—I'm a free spirit, so don't come if you don't want to, but I'm out of here! "
"Adrien"|"Tikki"|-0.287477552890778|"Did he go to get help?"
"Tikki"|"Oblivio"|-0.693384051322937|" I don't think we should hold our breath."
"Oblivio"|"Oblivio"|-0.0165963768959045|" Ladybug, Cat Noir, we know you're in here. You won't get away this time. "
"Oblivio"|"Adrien"|-0.145230948925018|" You remember your BFF Oblivio, don't you? Don't tell us you've forgotten us. Ha ha ha ha! "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.439823865890503|"I'm not convinced that this monster is really our best friend."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.613245189189911|"One thing's for sure, if we're superheroes, he can't find out about our secret identities."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.352721571922302|" How about some kind of diversion? We get out of here and take the emergency stairs."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.179963231086731|" Sorry, I need this. "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.454176664352417|"I'll call you, and when he comes, we make a run for it.I'll use the tape to pull your phone back. Ready?"
"Adrien"|"Oblivio"|0.333396077156067|" No wonder I fell in love with you. "
"Oblivio"|"Oblivio"|-0.794898718595505|" Uh uh. Gotcha.You shouldn't have forgotten to switch off your phone.Nooo! "
"Oblivio"|"Marinette"|-0.756763219833374|" You're trying to fool Oblivio again! But it's not gonna work this time.Or perhaps we give you too much credit. "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.620332598686218|" You saved our lives! Thank you. "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.3404301404953|"Let's head back to where we were. It's the last place he'll think of looking for us. "
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.57732567191124|" Pfft, a coward, me? Whatever! Huh?Adrien?I may not remember my own name, but I know for a fact that I'm brave andI… am…This is called psychological harassment!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.787849098443985|" Sorry, your phone's out of juice. "
"Adrien"|"Tikki"|-0.294784188270569|"No worries. We’re doing pretty well, even without powers, don't you think?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.725132346153259|" It's true, you two make a very effective couple. "
"Marinette"|"Pedestrian"|-0.44856870174408|" Yes, but if we want a real shot at defeating this villain, we're gonna have to become Ladybug and Cat Noir again.Maybe we can gather some hints by watching some news footage to see what happened before he erased our memories."
"Pedestrian"|"Roger"|0.61064612865448|" Hey, do something!"
"Roger"|"Pedestrian"|-0.0643956661224365|" What do you want me to do?"
"Pedestrian"|"Roger"|-0.36393004655838|" I don't know, you're the cop!"
"Roger"|"TVi Person"|0.0339276790618896|" I am? "
"TVi Person"|"Nadja"|0.33719801902771|" Nadja, you're on the air!"
"Nadja"|"Adrien"|-0.550584137439728|" Me? What do I do?Uh, don't be bemused, it's just the news. Since early this afternoon, a supervillain by the name of Oblivio has been erasing the memories of everyone he comes across. Ladybug and Cat Noir are tracking him down inside Montparnasse Tower. "
"Adrien"|"Hawk Moth"|0.222957372665405|" Well, right now, he's the one tracking us down."
"Hawk Moth"|"Oblivio"|-0.517792105674744|"Ladybug and Cat Noir are toying with you Oblivio. If you can't manage to find them…"
"Oblivio"|"Nadja"|-0.295604526996613|"Then we'll flush them out of hiding, Hawk Moth! "
"Nadja"|"Ladybug"|-0.393087804317474|"Looks like Ladybug and Cat Noir are struggling today. "
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.596048384904861|" And stop calling us a couple!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.680355936288834|" We don't exactly look lovey-dovey in this footage."
"Marinette"|"Nadja"|-0.637941718101501|" Probably just a regular fight like all couples have."
"Nadja"|"Marinette"|-0.689456045627594|" The battle against Oblivio continues.Oh, oh no! Cat Noir has been hit, but Ladybug pulls him out of danger.What's she doing now?Ladybug is down, too!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.379829883575439|" The drawing! There was a drawing on the elevator wall! I remember now. It was a turtle. I saw it earlier when I was looking for my mom's number.There it is! "
"Adrien"|"Master Fu"|-0.315566003322601|" You left yourself a message! So smart. "
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.0623084306716919|" Hello?"
"Marinette"|"Fu"|-0.53339084982872|"Mr. Turtle? "
"Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.713415890932083|" Marinette, is there a problem? "
"Marinette"|"Fu"|-0.214625537395477|" Listen. I can’t remember who I am or who you are. Oblivio has erased my memory. But I think I'm supposed to call you."
"Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.155383706092834|" You did the right thing. Is Cat Noir with you? "
"Marinette"|"Fu"|-0.33576887845993|"Yeah, well Adrien, actually."
"Fu"|"Adrien"|0.0847529172897339|" You two know your true identities, then. "
"Adrien"|"Fu"|-0.6077641248703|" We're not supposed to?"
"Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.578875154256821|" That's okay, the Miraculous Ladybugs will repair everything anyway. "
"Marinette"|"Fu"|-0.299105048179626|" We figured out we're superheroes, but we don't know how to make ourselves Ladybug and Cat Noir again.Mr. Turtle, you'll have to tell us quick, I'm almost out of battery."
"Fu"|"Marinette"|0.289836287498474|" Are your kwamis with you? "
"Marinette"|"Fu"|-0.293858230113983|" Uh, if you mean the flying creatures, then, one of them. The red one is with us."
"Fu"|"Adrien"|0.0783600807189941|" Okay. Listen carefully, the red kwami's name is Tikki.She gives you your powersSay, \"Tikki, spots on,\" and you'll transform into Ladybug. You'll find an emergency user's guide in your bug phone. Adrien, your kwami's the black one. His name is Plagg.Tell him, \"Plagg, claws out,\" and you'll become Cat Noir again. The rest is in your cat phone."
"Adrien"|"Fu"|-0.732461303472519|" But, my kwami took off."
"Fu"|"Tikki"|-0.660624802112579|" You won't be able to transform without him— "
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|-0.770383328199387|"You're a selfish being and a total coward!"
"Plagg"|"Oblivio"|0.0726157426834106|" I am not a coward, and I'm not selfish, either! But, maybe this Adrien boy has some yummy Camembert left. "
"Oblivio"|"Marinette"|0.150104522705078|" Ladybug, Cat Noir, if you don't come out of hiding and give us your Miraculous, this giant bubble's gonna erase the memories of every single person in Paris!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.401444911956787|" It's time to bring Ladybug back."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.203119039535522|" Tikki, spots on! Yeah!"
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.582153081893921|" Wow, that was amazing!"
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.556822091341019|"Thanks, but I don't feel like a superhero at all."
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.09482741355896|" You've already proven that you are one, with or without a costume. "
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|0.246669054031372|"Okay, there seems to be a kind of button here.User's guide?\"Yo-yo's features, capturing the akuma, one-time power, teapot and catches it) Uh! What am I supposed to do with this? Make tea?"
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.277222871780396|" Maybe it's part of a puzzle, or a riddle?"
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.505087405443192|" You're right, it must just be one part of the solution, but, how am I gonna find the solution?"
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.556841254234314|" Don't worry, you always have the right idea at the right time, you got this!"
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|0.341593265533447|"Mm hm.Hoo. It's time for action!"
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.370742917060852|"Marinette, I want to fight beside you.If we're a couple, then we'll be stronger together."
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.572392344474792|" But you don't have your kwami or your superpowers. And without your costume, the villain would know your true identity.But most of all, I wouldn't want anything to happen to you. I'm starting to understand how much you mean to me, Adrien.Please, stay there. Ladybug is here to protect you! "
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.331804752349854|"Whoa. I don't need any memory to know that I love that girl."
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|0.645968914031982|" \"The Miraculous enhances all physical abilities.\" Well, that'll come in handy."
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|-0.049123227596283|"It looks like Ladybug has gotten her powers back, but not her memory. Seize her Miraculous, Oblivio!"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.666510105133057|" Whoo hoo! Ha ha! Super agility is super awesome! "
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.641958653926849|" Ahh!"
"Ladybug"|"Oblivio"|-0.700731307268143|" Eh- aaah!"
"Oblivio"|"Adrien"|-0.44201534986496|"You've forgotten your reflexes, huh?Now we're gonna make sure you forget everything else, including your Miraculous!"
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.786131501197815|" Attacking m'lady on the ground, did you forget your manners?"
"Ladybug"|"Plagg"|-0.450761497020721|" Adri—"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.645185470581055|" So, can I be of any help in any way?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.510982394218445|"Plagg?"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.591489911079407|" Plagg? So that's my name, Plagg?"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.725161790847778|" Yeah, and you got here just at the right time. "
"Adrien"|"Cat Noir"|-0.491670966148376|" Plagg, claws out! Plagg:What's that gonna do— "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.560359716415405|" Hey, pretty cool, right? "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.390282869338989|"Very cool, but try not to lose your memory again!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.363658666610718|" Hm, \"Stick's features, superpower, Cata—\""
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.465313673019409|" Stop! It'll trigger it if you say it out loud."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.187124073505402|" And it says it can only be used once?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.4678555727005|" What does your power do, exactly?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.512133717536926|" Apparently, I can destroy anything I touch."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.516387432813644|"Then stay away from me, if you don't mind."
"Cat Noir"|"Oblivio"|-0.452655434608459|" That's not gonna be easy, Ma— Lady. "
"Oblivio"|"Cat Noir"|-0.597743421792984|" Seems like you've already forgotten about your last defeat!How silly of us, of course you've forgotten! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.627932846546173|" We won't stand a chance until we stop him from firing at us."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.205825865268707|" Of course! His left hand is different from the rest of his body! That must be where the akuma is hiding!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.173284769058228|" Okay, I've got no idea what the hakuna matata is, but I trust you. So what's the plan?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.432240664958954|" Can you get him to forget about me for a little while?"
"Cat Noir"|"Oblivio"|0.476686477661133|" I'm on it.Hey, you! Do you want to play cat and mouse with me? The first one who tags the other wins!"
"Oblivio"|"Ladybug"|-0.618440926074982|" What in the—?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.234534919261932|" Cat Noir, now!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.726003736257553|" Cataclysm! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.585960507392883|" No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye, bye, little butterfly."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.692982584238052|" Wow, so this villain was both these guys?What do we do about that?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.455503702163696|" This is where my other power comes in.It fixes everything back to how it was originally. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.194818019866943|" Wait. Do you think we'll remember all this… afterwards?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.592361450195312|" Apparently, my Miraculous Ladybug reverts everything, so I'm guessing we won't."
"Cat Noir"|"Alya"|0.685284972190857|" All right then. With your permission, m'Lady…"
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.611643075942993|"Uh…"
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.223827004432678|" Miraculous Ladybug!"
"Alya"|"Cat Noir"|-0.471933007240295|" Uh, Ladybug, Cat Noir?"
"Cat Noir"|"Nino"|0.0629072189331055|" Guys, you haven't seen a supervillain named Oblivio, have you?"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.608096063137054|" You've defeated it already, dude."
"Alya"|"Both"|-0.220492899417877|" Actually, he was… us."
"Both"|"Cat Noir"|-0.291189610958099|" Oh, okay. Pound it? Pound it! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.104847550392151|" We do make a good couple, don't you think?Otherwise we wouldn't have won again like we always do."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.590257793664932|"Ugh, we're a team, not a couple.Don't start that again!I've already told you that I'm in love with another boy.Besides, this charming kitty act of yours was the reason we became distractedand got into all this trouble in the first place.That's right laugh all you want—Hey, what are you doing?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.723871737718582|"Everyone saw that?!This is a disaster! What on earth happened?!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.529687941074371|" Well one thing's for sure,we would make a good-looking couple. We're meant for each other m'Lady. You're the only one who doesn't see it."
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.331351220607758|" This conversation is not over. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Alya"|-0.247571408748627|" I won't soon forget this, Ladybug and Cat Noir. The love you both secretly have for each other will be your downfall. "
"Alya"|"Mylène"|-0.503816574811935|"Right, so, Nino and I wanted to say, we're sorry for what happened today."
"Mylène"|"Marinette"|0.192856669425964|" Were you two Oblivio?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.701787084341049|" Why did you want to erase everyone's memory?"
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.146695613861084|"Remember when we visited Montparnasse Tower?Well, we went and hid to play Super Penguino,but Miss Bustier caught us,and—"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.675831943750381|"And you guys made fun of us for playing that game,saying it wasn't our age and all."
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.675712138414383|"We were totally embarrassed at getting caught."
"Nino"|"Ms. Bustier"|0.0129852294921875|" And that's when we got akumatized. "
"Ms. Bustier"|"Alya"|-0.711311936378479|"Next time, just make sure you play at home and not on school field trips, understood?"
"Alya"|"Rose"|-0.66876009106636|" Yes, Miss Bustier, we're sorry again."
"Rose"|"Mylène"|0.142252087593079|" It's no biggie, you know. Juleka and I often play Super Penguino together."
"Mylène"|"Sabrina"|0.464505910873413|" Everybody loves that game, you know."
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|0.082916259765625|"You know, sometimes even Chloé and I—"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|0.313398241996765|" Hey!"
"Adrien"|"Alya"|0.596575975418091|"I haven't played it yet, but it looks fun."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.58511745929718|"All you need is to find the right partner.Right Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.497837662696838|"Mm hm..."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.577026277780533|" I don't believe it!I actually kissed Cat Noir! How could this have happened?"
"Tikki"|"Adrien"|0.0840955972671509|" Who knows? Maybe you still have some things to learn about him."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.109496235847473|" I can't believe it, Plagg. She finally fell in love with me, and I've forgotten all about it! "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.786159604787827|"You're right, that's really unlucky. "
"Adrien"|"Cat Noir"|0.143060207366943|" You know what?It doesn't matter. If it happened once, it can happen again. At least now,I know my dream can come true."
"Lila's mother"|"Nino"|0.571671843528748|"Hi, darling. Your breakfast is on the table, your lunch is in a bag, and your dinner is in the fridge. I'll be home late tonight again, but I'll do my best to be there this weekend. Pinky promise. And just call me if you need anything. Love you to bits, my angel! "
"Nino"|"Lila"|-0.765500023961067|" Is something wrong, Lila?"
"Lila"|"Nino"|-0.298681914806366|" Uh, no, I'm doing great! It's just that... my mom wants me to go with her to this fancy embassy function tonight, but I got way too much homework and I'm so behind after being away for the first term. I'm just gonna have to tell her no. She'll be so upset..."
"Nino"|"Lila"|-0.736508965492249|" Oh, yeah. Bummer."
"Lila"|"Nino"|-0.561409503221512|" Adrien said he'd help me, but I don't want to bother him with it. He's probably forgotten anyway. He might think I've got a crush on him, just like all those other girls who are constantly hanging all over him."
"Nino"|"Lila"|0.698473334312439|" Adrien's a great dude. I'm sure he won't mind. I can put in a good word for you if you want."
"Lila"|"Nino"|0.662385106086731|" Oh, you'd do that for me? Oh thanks, Nino, you're the best!"
"Nino"|"Nino"|-0.468908190727234|" No sweat."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.24848198890686|"Hey, Adrien!"
"Adrien"|"Lila"|0.511599183082581|" Hi, Nino. What's up?"
"Lila"|"Adrien"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Adrien"|"Lila"|0.316751956939697|" Hey, Lila. Nino told me about your problem. I can still help you with your schoolwork if you want."
"Lila"|"Adrien"|0.423537254333496|" Really? You'd do that? You're such a great help! You're saving my life, you know."
"Adrien"|"Alya"|0.612967133522034|" No problem, Lila. Happy to help."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.623125314712524|"Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.668015658855438|"I was so not spying on Lila. I was just... tying my shoes."
"Alya"|"Lila"|-0.326287448406219|" You've got nothing to worry about. Nino told me Lila said she definitely doesn't have the hots for Adrien."
"Lila"|"Adrien"|-0.321583926677704|"Why don't we go to your place to do our homework? It would be so much quieter, would it?"
"Adrien"|"Lila"|-0.605365663766861|" My father would never agree to that."
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.190739989280701|" I bet you I can change his mind. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Alya"|"Lila"|-0.344752907752991|"Marinette! Wait!"
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.492386400699615|" Pfft! There's no way Adrien's bodyguard will let her in the car.Seriously?!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.162024796009064|" Don't tell me you're gonna follow them!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.544186174869537|" 'Course not! I'm just gonna go... to the swimming pool. "
"Marinette"|"Juleka"|0.379613518714905|"Hey, Juleka.Can I borrow your bike? It's an emergency! "
"Juleka"|"Tikki"|0.416792392730713|" I guess?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.492714703083038|" Marinette. You should just trust Adrien. He knows Lila's a liar."
"Marinette"|"Lila"|-0.658735126256943|" I know, but if she keeps on lying like she does, she's gonna end up hurting someone. I refuse to let her hurt Adrien!"
"Lila"|"Adrien"|-0.642488986253738|" What's the worst grade you've ever gotten?"
"Adrien"|"Lila"|-0.599649518728256|" An A- in math. Listen, Lila, you should forget about this. My father can be harsh with anyone he thinks is an intruder."
"Lila"|"Nathalie"|-0.770286247134209|"We're not doing anything wrong. Leave this to me."
"Nathalie"|"Lila"|-0.659296005964279|" I'm sorry, Adrien, but you know your father-"
"Lila"|"Nathalie"|0.445051908493042|" Excuse me, ma'am. But is there any way I could ask him directly? Just in case."
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|-0.770529255270958|" Mr. Agreste is busy designing and must not be disturbed for any reason."
"Adrien"|"Lila"|0.285696864128113|" I told you so."
"Lila"|"Nathalie"|-0.477890074253082|" Oh, Adrien. I so wanted to help you make up all the schoolwork you missed due to all the modeling you've been doing lately. What will your father think if he finds out about your lower grades, Adrien? Who will he believe?"
"Nathalie"|"Lila"|-0.661000341176987|" Adrien, have your grades gone down?"
"Lila"|"Nathalie"|-0.49014413356781|" He’d never tell you himself up when I saw Adrien crying the other day because he only got an A-, I just felt like I had to offer him my help. I would’ve taken half an hour.I understand. You’re only doing what you think is best. I did what I could, Adrien. Good luck."
"Nathalie"|"Lila"|-0.298264026641846|" If it's only half an hour... "
"Lila"|"Marinette"|0.0065760612487793|" If you really insist, I'll do it!"
"Marinette"|"Lila"|0.409779787063599|" Seriously? How does she do that? "
"Lila"|"Adrien"|0.530233144760132|" See? You never know until you ask nicely."
"Adrien"|"Lila"|-0.671010881662369|" You didn't ask nicely. You lied, Lila."
"Lila"|"Fireman"|-0.662358582019806|" You told me yourself that your A- in math is your lowest grade, didn't you?"
"Fireman"|"Marinette"|-0.700103014707565|" Hey, miss. You can't climb on that. It's too dangerous."
"Marinette"|"Fireman"|-0.356123507022858|" Could I borrow your ladder, please? The guy I'm in love with is about to be scammed by a liar."
"Fireman"|"Lila"|-0.71584141254425|" No. Firefighter's ladder is for real emergencies, not for spying on boys. Especially without a helmet."
"Lila"|"Plagg"|0.461038947105408|" Ah, is this your mom? You look so much like her. I look a lot like my mom too you know. Isn't it just crazy how much you and I have in common? "
"Plagg"|"Fireman"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Fireman"|"Lila"|-0.400207996368408|" And the lying girl's really that scheming?You really care about this boy, huh? "
"Lila"|"Adrien"|0.670121192932129|" This girl in red is pretty. Who is she?"
"Adrien"|"Lila"|0.204538106918335|" That's Kagami. We take fencing classes together."
"Lila"|"Adrien"|0.744673609733582|" She looks so nice. You'll have to introduce me to her sometime. Did you know I lived in Japan for a few years? "
"Adrien"|"Fireman"|-0.467190802097321|" Lila, didn't you want me to help you with your homework?"
"Fireman"|"Marinette"|0.0745401382446289|" There. Perfectly safe to climb.There."
"Marinette"|"Lila"|0.612814664840698|"Thank you! "
"Lila"|"Nathalie"|0.327206611633301|" Please don't tell me you're still a fan of that... that..."
"Nathalie"|"Lila"|-0.0988103151321411|" Time's up, Adrien. Your father could come out of his office at any minute."
"Lila"|"Marinette"|0.473648905754089|" I guess I won the bet. How 'bout a little souvenir photo?Feel free to ask if you need anymore help with your math. "
"Marinette"|"Tomoe"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Tomoe"|"Kagami"|-0.0908949971199036|" We agreed on no cell phone during practice, Kagami. You can check when you're done."
"Kagami"|"Lila"|-0.688861578702927|" I'm sorry, Mother. "
"Lila"|"Nathalie"|0.514923095703125|" Mr Gabriel Agreste! I am such an admirer of your fashion designs this is the best day of my life! I know how you're busy you are so I won't take up anywhere of your time. Have a good evening!"
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.711036771535873|" It's my fault sir, I'm..."
"Gabriel"|"Lila"|0.278293490409851|"In my office, NOW!"
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.253120541572571|" I could take a photo right now and post it online, but that would be too easy. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.12278813123703|"Tikki, spots o-"
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|-0.492408812046051|" Don't even think about it!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.293985664844513|"Why are you so nice to that girl? She lies with every breath and snoops through your drawers as soon as your back's turned."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.423762142658234|" You snoop through my drawers too, Plagg."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.288873374462128|" Yeah, but we both know I'm only looking for cheese. But she... well, we have no idea what she's looking for."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.468185663223267|" Perhaps she's just looking to be a little less lonely."
"Plagg"|"Gabriel"|-0.0973733067512512|"One, two, three, four, five..."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.00323909521102905|"What was that young girl doing in my house?"
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.617584347724915|" I decided it would be good for her to help Adrien review his mathematics."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.423709154129028|" I'm the only one who decides what's good for my son! This isn't the first time you've been fooled by his schoolmates."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.609720408916473|" Do you want... to take Adrien out of school?"
"Gabriel"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.704644590616226|" No. But I won't allow Adrien to be influenced by the company he keeps. On second thought, I think this photo is going to help me get that young girl in particular away from my son once and for all."
"Hawk Moth"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.65821972489357|" Such a tornado of negative emotions surrounding such as meaningless photo. But the strongest anger isn't always necessarily the nosiest one.Fly, my evil akuma, and unleash her anger!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Kagami"|-0.379944443702698|"Oni-Chan, I am Hawk Moth. I'm giving you the power to track down Lila Rossi and make sure she never gets close to your loved one ever again. Adrien Agreste is way too innocent to be wary of her. Of course she'll persuade Ladybug and Cat Noir to stop you from accomplishing your duty. You must therefore bring me their Miraculous, to punish them for their naivety."
"Kagami"|"Oni-Chan"|-0.387271881103516|" Yes, Hawk Moth. "
"Oni-Chan"|"Adrien"|0.521402359008789|" Adrien. I am Oni-Chan. You and I were made for each other, Adrien."
"Adrien"|"Oni-Chan"|-0.518932223320007|" Kagami?"
"Oni-Chan"|"Adrien"|-0.00131410360336304|" I will protect you from anyone who tries to harm you. I'll protect you from Lila. "
"Adrien"|"Oni-Chan"|-0.61474797129631|" She's not dangerous. She just craves attention."
"Oni-Chan"|"Adrien"|-0.662747204303741|" She doesn't deserve your attention. What she deserves is punishment! "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.621913343667984|" Kagami, no!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.420532941818237|"Can I transform now?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.0573465824127197|" Yes, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.554696828126907|"Tikki, spots on!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.693076223134995|" Wow. With all these girlfriends chasing you, I guess it was only a matter of time before they ended up fighting each another."
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.655543863773346|"I don't have any girlfriends!"
"Adrien"|"Oni-Chan"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Oni-Chan"|"Lila"|-0.319463491439819|" Lila.Lila Rossi!"
"Lila"|"Oni-Chan"|-0.587292939424515|" Ah!"
"Oni-Chan"|"Lila"|-0.396592617034912|" I forbid you to go anywhere near Adrien.Give up on him and I will spare you."
"Lila"|"Oni-Chan"|-0.28013664484024|" Adrien? I don't know anyone named Adrien."
"Oni-Chan"|"Lila"|-0.540495365858078|" Don't lie to me!"
"Lila"|"Oni-Chan"|-0.737511277198792|" I'm really sorry, but I always get what I want. It's not my fault."
"Oni-Chan"|"Cat Noir"|0.063879132270813|" Well this time you're gonna have to give in. Otherwise you'll really get it, whether you want it or not."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.481584429740906|" Don't you think you should ask the lucky guy what he thinks?Hey, I'm just trying to help."
"Ladybug"|"Lila"|0.248356103897095|" C'mon, this way! "
"Lila"|"Oni-Chan"|-0.636166304349899|" I don't need you, Ladybug. I was perfectly capable of defending myself. Besides, that ugly horned girl doesn't stand a chance with Adrien."
"Oni-Chan"|"Ladybug"|-0.501077711582184|" Are you really sure I don't stand a chance? "
"Ladybug"|"Oni-Chan"|-0.708821535110474|" Back off! "
"Oni-Chan"|"Cat Noir"|-0.409483075141907|"It's no use running. Wherever you go, I'll find you."
"Cat Noir"|"Lila"|-0.43469625711441|" Not before we capture your akuma anyway."
"Lila"|"Roger"|-0.657312601804733|" Please stop! Oh, officer, I'm being followed by a supervillain and Ladybug's failing miserably. You're the only one who can help me! Please protect me!"
"Roger"|"Ladybug"|0.408608794212341|" Get in. I can protect you down at the police center. "
"Ladybug"|"Roger"|0.175687789916992|" The akuma must be in her bokken, Cat Noir!"
"Roger"|"Lila"|-0.689564168453217|" Unfortunately, there's not much I can do about your forehead problem, though."
"Lila"|"Roger"|-0.652673125267029|" What forehead problem?Ah! What is this disgusting thing? "
"Roger"|"Ladybug"|0.158765554428101|"What kind of a message is this? "
"Ladybug"|"Roger"|-0.546552032232285|" What just happened?"
"Roger"|"Ladybug"|-0.713015526533127|" Where’s my car? What happened to the young lady with the horn on her forehead? The one being chased by that supervillain?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.083027720451355|" Lila?"
"Cat Noir"|"Oni-Chan"|0.0647209882736206|" Since when does she have a horn? "
"Oni-Chan"|"Ladybug"|0.112923860549927|" Go ahead and run. As fast and as far away as you can, Lila Rossi."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.175588607788086|" There! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.689779549837112|" I feel like she's taunting us."
"Ladybug"|"Lila"|-0.516565263271332|" She won't be laughing for long. "
"Lila"|"Sabine"|-0.653670340776443|" Help! There's a monster chasing me!"
"Sabine"|"Ladybug"|-0.273227393627167|" You have something on your forehead.Oh, what a strange message!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.466576218605042|" We've got her! "
"Cat Noir"|"Oni-Chan"|-0.597437024116516|" Not again! "
"Oni-Chan"|"Tom"|-0.428106606006622|" So, you still think you can get away from me?"
"Tom"|"Ladybug"|0.0635589361190796|" Honey? "
"Ladybug"|"Sabine"|-0.656616270542145|" Mo- uh, Miss Dupain-Cheng?"
"Sabine"|"Cat Noir"|-0.107438027858734|" I was in the bakery when this teenager with a horn came running in."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.083027720451355|" Lila."
"Ladybug"|"Oni-Chan"|0.0636075735092163|" Oni-Chan must be there already.Stay here! "
"Oni-Chan"|"Tom"|-0.703849107027054|" All you have to do is give up on Adrien, and all of this will stop."
"Tom"|"Cat Noir"|-0.722255021333694|"Ahem. Nobody attacks customers at the Dupain-Cheng bakery. And where is my wife?Wait!"
"Cat Noir"|"Lila"|-0.144764542579651|"Lila, are you okay?"
"Lila"|"Cat Noir"|-0.704290300607681|" You're rushing to my rescue even after all those nasty things I said to you? I really misjudged you, Ladybug! You're the only one who can help me! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.267549872398376|" I knew she'd wind up liking you in the end. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.107907295227051|"What kind of message is this? "
"Cat Noir"|"Tom"|-0.71805003285408|" Hey! Not cool! The girls were just starting to get along! "
"Tom"|"Ladybug"|-0.510462313890457|" Ladybug! My wife answered the phone, and then POOF, she disappeared! And then that villain showed up, and now you're here, and-"
"Ladybug"|"Tom"|-0.656148463487625|" Don't worry. Your wife is in a police car, safe and sound.The supervillain sends evil phone messages and swaps places with the person who looks at them. And Lila's horn acts as a kind of cell tower. That's how the villain always tracks her down. I know how to defeat her now, thanks to you! "
"Tom"|"Oni-Chan"|-0.168679296970367|"Oh?"
"Oni-Chan"|"Lila"|-0.650818109512329|" Give Adrien up!"
"Lila"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0494678020477295|" And let you get your monster paws on him? No way!"
"Cat Noir"|"Oni-Chan"|0.294599175453186|"Adrien, Adrien, Adrien. All the girls are fighting over him. No one's fighting over me. Yet I'm so much more sophisticated, funnier, and definitely better dressed than him."
"Oni-Chan"|"Cat Noir"|-0.363426506519318|"How dare you compare yourself to Adrien, you cursed cat! Adrien is perfection personified! He's the only one who's worthy of me! And the only one I will ever love! "
"Cat Noir"|"Oni-Chan"|0.585848450660706|"What?What are you smiling at?"
"Oni-Chan"|"Lila"|-0.423844218254089|" Do you get it now? I'll hunt you down wherever you go. Just give up on Adrien, and I'll stop tracking your every move."
"Lila"|"Oni-Chan"|-0.551339536905289|" Alright. I'll give up... on Adrien. "
"Oni-Chan"|"Lila"|-0.669578105211258|" You're an awesome actress, but you're lying. Your horn betrays you, see? It will only disappear once you've sincerely given up on Adrien."
"Lila"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.653169721364975|" But how could I possibly give Adrien up? I love him so much! It's too hard for me, honestly! You can't ask me to do that. The only thing that would persuade me to give him up if you got rid of Ladybug for me. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Oni-Chan"|0.769189715385437|"This Lila girl is... astounding!"
"Oni-Chan"|"Ladybug"|-0.16304224729538|" If that's the only thing that will make you give him up, I'll do it. "
"Ladybug"|"Lila"|-0.702739268541336|" Cat Noir, if anyone receives a text message, you can't let them open it. That's how Oni-Chan teleports herself. "
"Lila"|"Cat Noir"|-0.757336139678955|" Help, Cat Noir! It hurts so much! I think I might've broken something! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.176213920116425|" M'lady, I have an emergency. I won't be long."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.646359950304031|" Are you sure she's not pulling your leg?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.759005382657051|" She wouldn't do that now. She really looks like she's in pain. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.672806859016418|" Then I'm going to need a helping hand here. Lucky Charm! "
"Cat Noir"|"Oni-Chan"|-0.434318602085114|" Could you take this girl to the nearest hospital, please?"
"Oni-Chan"|"Ladybug"|-0.232642352581024|" You've been hosed, Ladybug. Adrien will be mine now, forever! "
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.586760878562927|" NO!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|0.587673187255859|"Yes! Take her Miraculous!"
"Ladybug"|"Fireman"|-0.708821535110474|"Back off!"
"Fireman"|"Cat Noir"|-0.743051677942276|" Well, this is what happens when you don't wear knee pads. "
"Cat Noir"|"Fireman"|-0.643630146980286|" No, don't look at your phone!"
"Fireman"|"Cat Noir"|-0.416025340557098|" But what if it's an emergency?"
"Cat Noir"|"Fireman"|-0.700021594762802|" Her leg's an emergency!"
"Fireman"|"Cat Noir"|-0.76094762980938|" You sure it's not her forehead instead because her leg looks fine."
"Cat Noir"|"Lila"|-0.696739584207535|"You just wanted me to leave Ladybug alone with the villain?You hate Ladybug... that much?"
"Lila"|"Cat Noir"|-0.730901807546616|" Me? Of course not. Why would you say that? Is it because she's been left alone to fight Oni-Chan all by herself? "
"Cat Noir"|"Lila"|-0.728533357381821|"What you just did is really terrible. You should be ashamed of yourself.Answer your phone, Mr. Hessenpy."
"Lila"|"Cat Noir"|-0.635732203722|" No! Don't do that!"
"Cat Noir"|"Fireman"|-0.18358314037323|" Yes, it's an emergency!"
"Fireman"|"Fireman"|-0.501477509737015|" Uh oh."
"Fireman"|"Cat Noir"|-0.674416363239288|" Ladybug?"
"Cat Noir"|"Fireman"|-0.411101579666138|" Surprise, Oni-Chan."
"Fireman"|"Ladybug"|-0.526537537574768|" What am I doing here? And how did you get all tied up like that?These hoses are so strong, it once took us two full hours to get a kid untangled."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.276298999786377|" Really?Wait! I’ve got a plan."
"Cat Noir"|"Lila"|0.694539427757263|"Yes, M’lady?It’s the girl of my dreams.Sure, I’ll bring her over to you right now.Hurry!"
"Lila"|"Cat Noir"|-0.29517924785614|"Hey! Oh, easy! My leg!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.20920729637146|"Need a helping paw, M’lady?"
"Ladybug"|"Oni-Chan"|0.100783586502075|" No, just a little phone call. "
"Oni-Chan"|"Ladybug"|-0.586760878562927|" NO! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.624045819044113|" Cat Noir!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.726003736257553|" Cataclysm! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.320563852787018|" No more evil-doing for you, little akuma! Time to deevilize!Gotcha!Bye, bye, little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.518932223320007|" Kagami. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.0630151033401489|" I’ll take her back home.Keep an eye on Lila. She’s as sly as a fox. "
"Ladybug"|"Lila"|-0.0291581153869629|" Your leg looks better."
"Lila"|"Ladybug"|0.682174682617188|" Being around you superheroes has toughened me up."
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.545215159654617|" You’ll be okay to go home by yourself, then. You don’t need me. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Lila"|-0.398572564125061|" I think I was mistaken. I shouldn’t chase that girl away. She could make a very good ally."
"Lila"|"Alya"|0.561373233795166|" Hey, Adrien? Could you help me with my homework after school?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.485866367816925|"What? You don’t have Adrien under surveillance anymore?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.359173059463501|" I trust him, Alya. Adrien could never love a girl like Lila, not in a million years."
"Adrien"|"Lila"|-0.552985399961472|" Sorry, I’ve got fencing. Besides, I think you’re already light years ahead of me when it comes to calculus."
"Lila"|"Adrien"|-0.442218661308289|" Actually, I have memory loss after all this traveling I’ve done. I need to learn everything again from scratch."
"Adrien"|"Lila"|-0.671092987060547|"Nathalie and my bodyguard got reprimanded last time because of you."
"Lila"|"Adrien"|-0.731506854295731|" I’m sorry, Adrien. Please, I didn’t mean to."
"Adrien"|"Lila"|-0.300388991832733|" Lila, you can always count on me. But not if you hurt the people I love. "
"Lila"|"Kagami"|0.0623084306716919|"Hello?"
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|0.442781090736389|" Congratulations. You’re at your best again, I see."
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.291142165660858|" I’m only trying to be worthy of you."
"Kagami"|"Lila"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Lila"|"Gabriel"|0.633819103240967|" Thank you for inviting me here, Mr. Agreste."
"Gabriel"|"Lila"|-0.650962948799133|"You got into my house without my authorization. By lying and manipulating my son."
"Lila"|"Gabriel"|-0.67015141248703|" I only meant well. Adrien needed to talk. You do such a good job of shielding him from bad influences that he actually feels very alone."
"Gabriel"|"Lila"|-0.696464508771896|" Hm. You’re opening my eyes to a problem I didn’t even know existed. What would you do in my position?"
"Lila"|"Gabriel"|0.316340923309326|" I think he needs a friend his age. Someone who understands him, who can protect him from negative influences. Someone you can trust, too."
"Gabriel"|"Lila"|0.535252094268799|" You and I think the same way. See you again very soon, Lila. "
"Lila"|"Lila's mother"|0.37115478515625|" See you soon, Mr. Agreste."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.688086628913879|" This is what we learned, thanks to the akumatization of Chloé Bourgeois as Miracle Queen."
"Gabriel"|"Miracle Queen"|0.338642120361328|" Yes... I remember..."
"Miracle Queen"|"Hawk Moth"|0.650869488716125|" People of Paris, listen to Miracle Queen's first order! From now on, no one will have to keep his identity a secret. All the Miraculous wearers, come to me!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Nathalie"|-0.54880166053772|"Yes! Yes!!! No more hiding!"
"Nathalie"|"Mayura"|0.538305044174194|" Since then,I created Optigami."
"Mayura"|"Nathalie"|0.693515539169312|" My beautiful Ladybug's secrets."
"Nathalie"|"Nathalie"|-0.305184066295624|" Under my control, Optigami followed each of the Miraculous holders. Alas, they're just ordinary teenagers-"
"Nathalie"|"Nathalie"|0.0845934152603149|"–who spend their time between school and extracurricular activities."
"Nathalie"|"Nathalie"|0.616664409637451|"True, Ladybug sometimes trusts them with a Miraculous. "
"Nathalie"|"Nathalie"|-0.468750596046448|"But she's established rules that prevent anyone from discovering her secret identity: she never shows her face, always takes back the Miraculous, and makes sure no one ever follows her."
"Nathalie"|"Nathalie"|-0.661561638116837|"Even Optigami couldn't stay on her tail."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.250047206878662|" We will learn nothing more with the Sentimonster."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.34774786233902|" On the contrary, I believe that it will help us finally discover who is behind Ladybug's mask. There's a flaw when the holder gives their miraculous back.There. Imagine if Optigami was hiding in the Miraculous ladybug took back it would lead us straight to her home, unknowingly."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.356841325759888|" Brilliant. But how do you plan to do that?"
"Gabriel"|"Audrey"|0.4119873046875|" I need an event where all the holders will be sure to come, and a super-villain will force ladybug to assign a Miraculous if she wants to defeat it. And I know just the right person for it."
"Audrey"|"Gabriel"|-0.729626536369324|" Are you serious?! Where is the glitter that I asked for? You're useless, utterly useless.Shoo, shoo!"
"Gabriel"|"Audrey"|0.755876183509827|" Audrey, once again this idea was formidable."
"Audrey"|"Gabriel"|0.701064467430115|" Utterly formidable, you mean! ... What was the idea again?"
"Gabriel"|"Audrey"|0.366104364395142|" This new award by your magazine, the Fashion Icon of the Month, and I was thinking, what better way to launch the award than by electing my son?"
"Audrey"|"Alya"|0.610993623733521|"I'll take care of the invitations right now."
"Alya"|"Alya"|0.526555418968201|"Basically, everyone's invited to this party, where Adrien's gonna receive the Fashion Icon award from Style Queen magazine!"
"Alya"|"Roaar"|-0.691537588834763|" That's why she's been paralyzed for ten minutes."
"Roaar"|"Kwamis"|0.714308738708496|" Roar! Since everyone's invited, can we come too?"
"Kwamis"|"Marinette"|0.261122941970825|" Yeah! "
"Marinette"|"Trixx"|-0.730764508247375|" Wait a sec. Sorry, but you know the rule.No holder, no wander. "
"Trixx"|"Marinette"|0.676346182823181|" In that case, I can come since I have a holder."
"Marinette"|"Trixx"|-0.519949376583099|" Technically no, I hold on to her Miraculous."
"Trixx"|"Alya"|0.130324125289917|" Well then, just give it to her permanently. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.135643243789673|" Trixx isn't wrong, Marinette. Now that I know you're Ladybug, I can help you."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.682546496391296|" No, that'd be too risky. You know the rule, no Miraculous out of my sight, no flight."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.451823353767395|" You're the guardian, your call.Besides, it's time to go see Adrien at the Fashion Icon."
"Marinette"|"Nino and Alya"|-0.388314068317413|" Adrien!"
"Nino and Alya"|"Kim"|-0.244495987892151|" Yeah!Pew pew! Pew pew! "
"Kim"|"Max"|0.27228307723999|" I bet I can get there before the elevator does! Max, time me. "
"Max"|"Alya"|0.647375345230103|" Ready.. GO! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.574860692024231|"Elevators are perfect for getting close to your secret crush! "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.574678242206573|" What? No!What if we accidentally... touch?! "
"Marinette"|"Nino and Alya"|-0.350586771965027|" Let's.. not rush things, 'kay?"
"Nino and Alya"|"Audrey"|-0.244495987892151|" Yeah!Pew pew! Pew pew! "
"Audrey"|"Unnamed presenter"|-0.731097459793091|" Urgh! If you don't start filming this instant, you're fired!"
"Unnamed presenter"|"Audrey"|-0.372257888317108|" But we have to wait for Alec Cataldi, he's the MC!"
"Audrey"|"Nathalie"|-0.769710853695869|" Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous!"
"Nathalie"|"Shadow Moth"|0.256493449211121|" Optigami is in place sir."
"Shadow Moth"|"Alec"|-0.314155161380768|" Ladybug has no idea that her defeat will be captured on film. Icing on the cake."
"Alec"|"Shadow Moth"|0.296955823898315|" Yeah! Come on!"

And today, I learned that I need an ally who will replace me if something happens to me one day.From now on, you will keep the Miraculous of the Fox with you, and I'm going to tell you everything I know."

"Wayhem"|"Adrien"|-0.619738519191742|" Seriously? You never have friends over?That's harsh. One of these days, I'm gonna come over and change your dad's mind and we'll have a rocking good time. For real!"
"Adrien"|"Wayhem"|-0.115927934646606|" My father doesn't change his mind very easily, but I appreciate the thought. Okay, gotta go finish my homework before the shoot. See you, Wayhem."

"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.486758828163147|" Why don't you make the most of your father being out of town? Have some friends over and live it up a little. "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.428064942359924|" You know my father has very high expectations of me. I can't go behind his back like that. Besides, even if I wanted to live it up a little, my bodyguard's keeping an eye on me and making sure I stay in line."

"Max"|"Nino"|-0.583277970552444|" Yes, and the probability of the girls being terribly disappointed if we don't participate is 100%."

"Nino"|"Ivan"|-0.756811007857323|" Dude, you don't actually have a swimming lesson. That's just your excuse."
"Ivan"|"Nino"|-0.624778062105179|" But isn't that lying?"
"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.268686354160309|" Sorry, but Max is right. The girls can't know about this. So, is this mission still on? For Adrien?Guys? "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.634832948446274|"Hey, weren't the boys supposed to be here?"
"Alya"|"Mylène"|0.311531662940979|" Nino was asked at the last minute to DJ his grandma's birthday party."

"Ivan"|"Max"|0.599013090133667|" We get to have it whenever we want."
"Max"|"Adrien"|-0.288901567459106|" So we’ve come up with a plan to right this injustice."
"Adrien"|"Boys"|-0.193854570388794|" That’s really cool of you all. But my father would never allow this. It’d be best if you...Uh, but hey! As long as it’s not for very long and he never, ever finds out about it..."

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.669116407632828|" You lied to your friends...?"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.762461438775063|" I didn’t want to upset Mylène. It was her idea to plant the trees this afternoon. But something totally fishy’s going on. All the boys are unavailable with really lame excuses, and trust me, I know a lame excuse when I hear them. I’ve turned into an expert at them since I became... you-know-who.I know, I’m gonna call Ivan. He can’t lie to save his life. If there’s something secret going on, he’ll definitely blab."

"Nino"|"Max"|-0.652694255113602|"Don’t pick up! You can’t lie to save your life. If she finds out we’re here, you can say goodbye to guy time. "
"Max"|"Marinette"|-0.246117830276489|" It’s Marine– "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.221907734870911|" Proves my point. They’re all together. And I may have an idea of where they could be.Adrien’s dad left town for Tokyo’s fashion week. While the cat’s away, the mice will play."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.305144011974335|" Why can’t we just answer Marinette?"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.799897059798241|" Because… you don’t want to get distracted from your only chance to hang out with your guys."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.567158848047256|" But isn’t Marinette... one of my guys?"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.578378081321716|" Yes... but no. Right now, she’s with her guys, so we aren’t going to go and disturb her and her guys. Otherwise we wouldn’t be the good guys. Get it?"

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.478614449501038|" Are you sure this is a good idea?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.674610525369644|" All the guys are together at Adrien’s place, so why can’t I be there too? I’ll just pretend I was passing by and, uh..."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.584946006536484|" Yet another lie?"
"Marinette"|"Ivan"|-0.193990170955658|" Just a half truth."

"Nathaniel"|"Marc"|-0.423827826976776|" Well, I'd still rather be working on our comic."
"Marc"|"Nathaniel"|-0.297849357128143|" But you can't skip the class, don't you realize? Miss Bustier got Mr. Didier to come here. He's a legend in sports journalism, a real walking encyclopedia of soccer."

"Miss Bustier"|"Didier Roustan"|-0.64760884642601|" That means we're missing a player."

"Didier Roustan"|"Ladybug"|0.582610487937927|" Nice rainbow flip, perfectly executed by Ladybug!"

"Ladybug"|"Carapace"|-0.685753732919693|"Okay Penalteam, we'll keep playing.So we can't win, she'll never let us and the glasses are out of reach. The only way to end this is if Chloé rejects the Akuma herself. We'll have 5 minutes to make the Penalteam despise playing soccer so much, that she'll quit the game."
"Carapace"|"Ladybug"|-0.0891557335853577|" How?"
"Ladybug"|"Vesperia"|-0.444335877895355|" By making her realize she can't win. We'll be a team of invincible superheroes! We will use our powers indefinitely without ever transforming back!"
"Vesperia"|"Ladybug"|-0.459960639476776|" But that's impossible! If we use our powers, we will transform back after 5 minutes."
"Ladybug"|"Caprikid"|0.00709879398345947|" True, but we can make the Penalteam believe otherwise. Thanks to Caprikid's power."

"Ladybug"|"Caprikid"|-0.496862828731537|" Never claim a goal before the ball has crossed the line Penalty! "

"Penalteam"|"Ladybug"|-0.642279714345932|" So you're just gonna keep scoring everytime? That's not fair!"

"Pixelator"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.711424231529236|" Ugh! Where did they go?"
"Hawk Moth"|"Pixelator"|0.0469193458557129|" If you want Jagged, you must find Ladybug."
"Pixelator"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.644250363111496|" I don't have time to deal with this Ladybug!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Pixelator"|0.506567716598511|" Yes, you do. Plenty of time. "
"Pixelator"|"Hawk Moth"|0.102657198905945|" Okay, okay! Tell me what to do."
"Hawk Moth"|"Jagged Stone"|0.661487102508545|" I command an excellent photograph of Ladybug with her Miraculous. I want those powers! So listen very carefully."

"Ladybug"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.626003056764603|" Yes! Pixelator would never imagine his idol would actually want a day out at school."

"Jagged Stone"|"Ladybug"|-0.702167123556137|" This is ridiculous. I don't have time for this. First, I get practically hijacked by this crazed fan, and then, I'm attacked by some super weirdo, then..."

"Adrien"|"Chloé"|-0.572205752134323|"I'm gonna see if there's a way out down there. Don't go anywhere. Could be dangerous. "
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|-0.747485667467117|" Dangerous?"

"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.223312318325043|" Oh, this isn't creepy at all."
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.612575769424438|" What? "
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.674416363239288|" Ladybug?"
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|0.0711135864257812|" What are you two doing there?"
"Chloé"|"Théo"|-0.640168100595474|" Ladybug! Remember me? Your biggest fan? Please, please get us out of here. It's terrible in here!I mean, it's only terrible when you're not around."

"Mireille"|"Ladybug"|-0.537572890520096|" Help... Ladybug!"
"Ladybug"|"Théo"|-0.650712996721268|" What happened to you?"
"Théo"|"Mireille"|-0.715811759233475|" It's terrible, this man, he... took a photo of us and we ended up trapped in here!"
"Mireille"|"Ladybug"|-0.290306746959686|" While we were just simply strolling the Champs-Élysées!"
"Ladybug"|"Nadja"|0.151334762573242|" I sure hope Cat Noir's there already! "
"Nadja"|"Pixelator"|0.0972543954849243|"Excuse me, sir, sir? Care for an interview with the reporter who spreads the villains' voice? "
"Pixelator"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.477788925170898|" I will continue my photoshoot until Jagged Stone turns up here in the flesh! Where are you, Jagged? Your biggest fan awaits you! All I want is one photo! Otherwise, soon, the people of Paris will be nothing but memories. "
"Mr. Damocles"|"Jagged Stone"|-0.812343135476112|" This is terrible!"
"Jagged Stone"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.000307798385620117|" I've got to do what Pixelator says!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Jagged Stone"|-0.680721759796143|" Surely, you can't be serious! It's dangerous out there!"
"Jagged Stone"|"Ladybug"|-0.705041408538818|" Who cares about danger? Jagged Stone can turn down a television appearance! Just imagine what it would do for my career!"
"Ladybug"|"Pixelator"|-0.756160035729408|" Got an itchy trigger finger, eh? "
"Pixelator"|"Pixelator"|-0.419040441513062|" I was expecting you, Ladybug."

"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|0.194541692733765|" I have a proposition to make! If you free those innocent people, I'll organize a photoshoot with Jagged Stone!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Pixelator"|-0.632838934659958|" No! Don't listen to her! She's trying to trick you!"
"Pixelator"|"Ladybug"|-0.00987923145294189|" Why should I believe you, Ladybug?"
"Ladybug"|"Pixelator"|-0.718889236450195|" Because you have no choice. I'm the only one who knows where Jagged is."
"Pixelator"|"Ladybug"|0.194721102714539|" How about I free half of them now and the other half after the photoshoot. Deal?"
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.00329697132110596|" 'Kay. It's a deal.Yeah, right."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.779190346598625|" Dudes! You just scared me!"

"Nino"|"Plagg"|0.245001792907715|" What do you think I've been doing this whole time?"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.364121317863464|" If you want my opinion, I think someone's been akumatized."
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.146586120128632|" I think you're right. But where's the akuma?"
"Adrien"|"Pixelator"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"

"Marinette"|"Harry"|-0.0633906126022339|" Oh, shoot. Well that's that, I guess."
"Harry"|"Marinette"|0.0135326385498047|" Oh, but you've already seen it with your little family. Honk! "
"Marinette"|"Harry"|-0.198595404624939|" Actually, it's not for me. It's for... for this boy in my class, Adrien Agreste. He's a big fan of yours and... I thought he would've liked a chance to go to your show and we could've laughed together, side by side..."

"Harry"|"Gabriel"|0.723094940185547|" This will be my most personal film. I wrote it all on my own. I even made some drawings! I brought back the character from my first show. Remember, Gaby? You did the costume."
"Gabriel"|"Harry"|-0.584662079811096|" I thought we agreed never to mention that again."
"Harry"|"Gabriel"|0.447676539421082|" In the film, Super-Fry must save the day with his hero friends, Camembert Justice and Wonder Potato! Honk!"

"Harry"|"Harry"|-0.351237058639526|" Of course not, my dear Gaby! I'm done with silly jokes. This is a serious movie with strong emotions, love, sadness, and a real proper villain like Hawk Moth! \"I give you the power to be an evil French fry!\" Honk!"
"Harry"|"Gabriel"|0.754650354385376|" I'm meeting with my producer tonight to present the project, and if Adrien were there too, I could introduce them after the show!"
"Gabriel"|"Harry"|0.401449680328369|" I will have to approve the script if the project happens."

"Marinette"|"Harry"|-0.502942770719528|" What if he doesn't laugh?"
"Harry"|"Marinette"|0.276597738265991|" He will. You told me he knew my sketches. Of course, don't forget to always add the gimmick at the end. Honk! That's what gives rhythm to the sketch and lets the audience, I mean Adrien, know that's time to laugh. Yee-haw?"

"Bob"|"Harry"|-0.644053757190704|"That's too funny!"
"Harry"|"Bob"|0.426958203315735|" No, it's not! It's touching! It's a serious superhero movie, Bob."
"Bob"|"Harry"|-0.745678156614304|" But you're a clown, Harry. No one wants you to make a drama. It will never bring us in as much money as your shows."
"Harry"|"Bob"|-0.326995193958282|" I'm not doing this for the money. When I was a kid, I dreamed of being a superhero."
"Bob"|"Harry"|-0.0138396024703979|"Well, write a comedy sketch about it!"
"Harry"|"Bob"|0.000878334045410156|" No. I wanna speak to my public in a new wayto help people dream, to help them feel more emotions than just laughter."
"Bob"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.688892066478729|" The only dreams I care about are the ones my piggy bank has about being filled with more money. Forget about your movie! It's a bad idea.Your public is waiting for you! "

"Shadow Moth"|"Harry"|-0.281029880046844|"Psycomedian, I am Shadow Moth. They refuse to believe that you can create other emotions besides laughter. Well, you're going to show them that no one can play with their emotions better than you!"

I wanted to make her something but with everything going on I barely had time get started on it. It's such a bummer because today would've been the perfect day to make it up to her.Hang on! What if I buy her a gift before going to meet her, and give it to her at the restaurant!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.276559710502625|" Great idea Marinette! But first, we've got to take care of a sentimonster."

"Roger"|"Ticket Inspector"|-0.336718320846558|" Does this mean we can cancel the fine and the id check?"
"Ticket Inspector"|"Marinette"|-0.62263211607933|" Well, that doesn't change the fact that this lady was on the bus without a ticket! The situation is a bit complex. But I guess that- yes it would be reasonable to cancel it all."
"Marinette"|"Ticket Inspector"|-0.678137421607971|" The truth is- I was out of line too.I am so- so sorry, mom. This is all my fault. which is why I'd like to pay the fine with my pocket money."

"Marinette"|"Orikko"|-0.504316300153732|" No, it's for a movie.You know, those make-believe stories they show on TV?"
"Orikko"|"Marinette"|0.56399393081665|" Are you gonna be famous?"
"Marinette"|"Nadja"|-0.576096922159195|" No, I'm the costume designer, I'm not acting in it. We are gonna be on the news.I'm gonna be late! "
"Nadja"|"Clara"|0.485169410705566|" And now, the very original project coming from the Françoise Dupont school in Paris. Clara Contard reporting."
"Clara"|"André"|0.675718903541565|" Under the initiative of the art teacher, Thomas Astruc, who's become a successful film director, is participating in an ambitious project.He's overseeing this group of students who are volunteering their own vacation time to produce a real-life movie.From script to storyboard, not to mention costumes, —everything's being done by the students themselveswith financial support from Paris' city hall."
"André"|"Clara"|0.696379423141479|" Yes; you know, I myself directed a few in my youth, and—"
"Clara"|"Zoé"|0.579132556915283|" And the cherry on top is that the film will be released in select movie theaters thanks to famous producer Bob Roth.What a lucky break for these student-filmmakers, as well as for the two young actresses who'll be starring in the main role!"
"Zoé"|"Chloé"|-0.11513078212738|"You may hate me, but I love you, and I always will!"
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|0.378178000450134|"A film with my half-of-a-sister as the star?! Ridiculous!"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|0.533657193183899|"Do you want another banana, Chloé? I've heard they help put people in a better mood."
"Chloé"|"Zoé"|-0.183322310447693|"What I want is to go tell that bunch of lamoes how things work in real life!In my life."
"Zoé"|"Chloé"|-0.11513078212738|" You may hate me, but I love you, and I always will—"
"Chloé"|"André"|-0.775751292705536|"How dare you all! Giving the lead role to my half-of-a-sister who just came out of nowhere?! And with daddy's money, on top of it all."
"André"|"Chloé"|-0.454923868179321|" Uh, it's not actually funded by me, sweetheart, but by the city."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.265631973743439|" Same thing.You—I told you that you'd be sent back to New York if you ever crossed my path, and now, not only are you on my path, but on TV, too!"
"Marinette"|"Thomas"|-0.261998295783997|" Don't let your sister walk all over you, Zoé. You are made for this part, you deserve it!"
"Thomas"|"Jean-Pierre"|-0.260677695274353|" It's true, and we're meeting with the producer tomorrow, so it's too late to change anything now."
"Jean-Pierre"|"Chloé"|-0.696562469005585|" Might I remind you that you were offered a chance, like all the students in the school, to participate in the film, but you refused because, and I quote, \"Mylène's sweater is too ugly, Nate draws like a 2-year-old, Alya is useless and Marinette is ridiculous, utterly ridiculous\"?"
"Chloé"|"Jean-Pierre"|-0.123747229576111|" I said that?"
"Jean-Pierre"|"Chloé"|-0.547730207443237|" Less politely."
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.487850844860077|" Well, I still mean all of it. But if this stupid, childish film actually gets released in theaters and turns someone into a star, that someone should be me. So, you're gonna give me the part my half-of-a-sister is playing because everything she owns is mine. "
"Sabrina"|"André"|-0.425189137458801|" Banana, Chloé? "
"André"|"Thomas"|-0.45286899805069|" Don't worry, kids, I'll go talk to her, everything will be fine tomorrow. "
"Thomas"|"Chloé"|0.650353908538818|" And here's the office of the producer, Bob Roth."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.06416255235672|"Surprise! "
"Marinette"|"Bob"|-0.0806921124458313|"Chloé, what are you doing here?!"
"Bob"|"Marinette"|0.0989705324172974|" My old friend André told me you'd be okay making a few small changes in the script so that his daughter could be part of the film."
"Marinette"|"Bob"|-0.676902711391449|" But it's impossible, we've prepped and gotten everything set!"
"Bob"|"Marinette"|-0.148547947406769|" Moviemaking, kid, is the art of compromise. To protect your—I mean, the interest of the film, you gotta be flexible, therefore, André's daughter will play the starring role."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.394203662872314|" That's not in the best interests of the film! Zoé is perfect for the role of the superhero of creation."
"Chloé"|"Zoé"|0.145599603652954|" The next plane for New York leaves in 30 minutes. "
"Zoé"|"Chloé"|-0.557188719511032|"Marinette, no big deal if I don't play the main role. There is lots of other positions of the non-act crew."
"Chloé"|"Bob"|0.455524802207947|" Perfect, as long as she's not on-screen, it's fine with me."
"Bob"|"Chloé"|0.70497739315033|" Then it's a deal! See you all tomorrow morning on set."
"Chloé"|"Bob"|-0.736423641443253|" Bye-bye, losers!"
"Bob"|"Marinette"|-0.519286513328552|"Now get out! "
"Marinette"|"André"|-0.751288115978241|" This is totally unfair! "
"André"|"Chloé"|0.271353721618652|" Believe this or not, I also shot a film in my youth. It was called \"Solitude\"."
"Chloé"|"André"|-0.102013051509857|" Daddy, I'm trying to concentrate here!"
"André"|"Chloé"|-0.474277675151825|" Of course, sorry, sweetheart."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.787870615720749|" And you, Dupain-Cheng, cool it with the horrible costume, it's worse than . "
"Marinette"|"Nino"|0.751750707626343|" That's why it suits you so well, Chloé. "
"Nino"|"Chloé"|0.586301207542419|" In this scene, the entire population has been put into an enchanted sleep, so we need tons of extras.You guys are gonna lay down here.Perfect!"
"Chloé"|"Nino"|-0.0227274894714355|" Hey! All of you! Someone just told me I'm supposed to play the role of the supervillain of destruction and Mylène is the superhero of creation. Are you kidding me?! I get the lead role, I am the good guy, okay?"
"Nino"|"Chloé"|0.65922999382019|" Chloé, those two roles are equally as impor—"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.595988601446152|" Blah, blah, blah, I don't care. I get to be the good guy."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.580521792173386|" We don't have time for all of these changes, Chloé!"
"Chloé"|"Thomas"|0.348171591758728|" Oh yeah? DADDY! "
"Thomas"|"Marinette"|-0.325396001338959|" You know, it's not uncommon to have to adapt the script on the set at the last minute for production reasons. It's called—"
"Marinette"|"Thomas"|-0.719570845365524|" That's baloney, a waste of time, giving up on your dreams?"
"Thomas"|"Nino"|0.0155755281448364|" ...a revision."
"Nino"|"Chloé"|-0.151115000247955|" If it's for the good of the film...Scene 9, take one.Action!Chloé, you're supposed to be acting!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.664211392402649|"Lame! Boring! Dull!What we need is a superhero film featuring a real superhero. Hey!What's black and yellow, has pretty blonde hair,gets everyone's attention and is gonna break the box office?"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.540642738342285|" You're not talking about you as Queen Bee? 'Cause most of the time you were a super-disaster more than a superhero."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.261407017707825|" Uh, actually, I wasn't even thinking of Queen Bee. I was thinking of a much more original character: Queen... uh...Queen Banana! "
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.239572465419769|" Queen what?"
"Chloé"|"Nino"|-0.0828880071640015|" DADDY! "
"Nino"|"Chloé"|0.007232666015625|" Scene 9, take 2.Action!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.58315372467041|" Ah, this is way better than that ridiculous costume Dupain-Cheng made, but it's still missing something. I know, I need wheels! "
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.220340490341187|" You don't need a car, these superheroes can fly."
"Chloé"|"Nino"|0.234800696372986|" What do you know about superheroes, baker girl? Just go back to sleep while I— DADDY!"
"Nino"|"Chloé"|0.167976021766663|" Scene 9, take 3.Action!"
"Chloé"|"Nino"|-0.433382153511047|" Ha! We can start now.Except, when she sees you all just lying around doing nothing, Queen Banana doesn't feel like saving you, she feels more like tossing you in the garbage."
"Nino"|"Chloé"|-0.662723660469055|" Chloé, we're not changing everything again!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.225472450256348|" Who said change everything? We just need a bigger and better challenge for Queen Banana! DADDY! "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.73331081867218|" Thanks, Adrien. It's really gorgeous of you—I mean, generous of you—to come help us."
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.742109656333923|" Happy to, Marinette. My father said it was for the good of the film. "
"Chloé"|"Nino"|-0.507758855819702|" At least he is worth saving."
"Nino"|"Chloé"|0.494964599609375|"Okay, now can we shoot?"
"Chloé"|"Max"|-0.26306939125061|" Hm, we need a new bad guy: a super-duper-ubervillain! "
"Max"|"Rose"|-0.227912127971649|" A galactic emperor?"
"Rose"|"Alya"|-0.227759957313538|" A giant octopus that comes from outer space?"
"Alya"|"Chloé"|-0.0389701128005981|" A fire breathing dragon?"
"Chloé"|"Nino"|-0.404251933097839|" No, no, those are so lame! I want a giant yellow gorilla that throws exploding bananas."
"Nino"|"Chloé"|0.515619397163391|"It's for the good of the film."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.451958239078522|"Are you kidding? I want a real, dynamite-slinging gorilla, not some cardboard monkey!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.714368164539337|" But Chloé, giant yellow dynamite-slinging apes do not exist!"
"Chloé"|"Kim"|0.155773878097534|" There are tons of giant gorillas doing stuff in all the good movies, can't you just hire one of those? Ugh, I'm so tired of all of you!I'm getting some beauty rest at the Palace, tomorrow you'd better have this monkey business figured out. "
"Kim"|"Marinette"|0.462345838546753|" Maybe the zoo will lend us an ape if we take extra good care of it."
"Marinette"|"Max"|-0.421274363994598|" You're not really gonna look for a giant dynamite-flinging gorilla?"
"Max"|"Marinette"|0.516893625259399|" It's for the good of the film, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.476295173168182|" It's not for the good of the film, it's not even a film anymore, it's just Chloé's fantasy! The only thing we're gonna do right now is get Adrien out of that cage.Then we're gonna shoot the story that we all thought of together. That's for the good of the film! "
"Chloé"|"Man"|-0.185101389884949|"Where's my giant gorilla? Where are all the others?Why isn't anyone here to shoot my big scene?"
"Man"|"Chloé"|-0.35228818655014|" They shot everything last night. Right about now they're probably over at the movie theater screening it."
"Chloé"|"Mylène "|-0.283884286880493|"What's that?! "
"Mylène "|"Zoé "|-0.767947822809219|" Ultimate Nightmare! "
"Zoé "|"Zoé "|-0.719319760799408|" Harmonic Wind!"
"Zoé "|"Mylène "|-0.465193510055542|"I've freed you from evil!"
"Mylène "|"Zoé "|-0.633239924907684|"Why did you wake them, Kreatika? Humans have destroyed the planet! They don't deserve to be awake! "
"Zoé "|"Mylène "|0.317020058631897|"You're wrong, Destroika. Each one of those humans carries the hope of a better world within them!"
"Mylène "|"Zoé "|-0.54381474852562|" You're just like them, I hate you! "
"Zoé "|"Chloé"|-0.568918317556381|" You may hate me, but I love you,and I always will, even if the whole world hates you,sister."
"Chloé"|"Gabriel"|-0.50264984369278|"This is ridiculous! Who authorized shooting this without me? Where's my monkey? And what is my half-of-a-sister doing in my movie?!"
"Gabriel"|"Chloé"|0.620283842086792|"Miss Dupain-Cheng convinced me to watch this first scene. I found it very moving and... Adrien is exceptional in it. I've therefore decided to privately finance the movie based on the original screenplay."
"Chloé"|"Bob Roth"|-0.0828880071640015|" DADDY!"
"Bob Roth"|"Marinette"|-0.37488979101181|"Like we said before, kid:movie making's all about compromise. "
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.425881743431091|" Sorry, Chloé. It was for the good of the film."
"Chloé"|"Gabriel"|-0.785825431346893|"Ridiculous!Utterly ridiculous!"
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|0.596029281616211|"But most of all, it's for the good of my plan. Chloé is always an excellent source of inspiration."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.0627252459526062|" Nooroo, Duusu, Unify!"
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|-0.0561403036117554|" Hey, wait!"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|-0.354574501514435|"Adrikins, it's sweet of you to want to console me, but I'm fine. I'm going to get my revenge and send Zoé back to New York."
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|-0.487663626670837|" Actually, I came to suggest that you apologize to everyone."
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|-0.757750645279884|"Are you ill?! They've ruined my film!"
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|-0.680960863828659|" It was never your film, Chloé. It belonged to the group. You promised me you'd make an effort to stop being mean to everyone. I warned you that if you didn't, then we can no longer be friends."
"Chloé"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.71173757314682|"You're as ridiculous that film! It's over, you're no longer my Adrikins, you're Adrinothing! "
"Shadow Moth"|"Chloé"|0.230505466461182|"Queen Banana, I am Shadow Moth. Once again, they refuse to recognize your true talent, so I give you the power to show them who the real star of Paris is."
"Chloé"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.228170812129974|" Fine, but I want a giant monkey who throws exploding bananas."
"Shadow Moth"|"Chloé"|0.606886148452759|"It's all arranged. I am the director of your dreams. In exchange for your powers- "
"Chloé"|"Queen Banana"|0.704215288162231|" Yeah, yeah, I know, Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous. You'll have them!"
"Queen Banana"|"Adrien"|-0.743892520666122|" Banana Boom-Boom, action!Where is my useless half-of-a-sister? Banana Boom-Boom,them off!"
"Adrien"|"Zoé"|-0.651455760002136|"Plagg, claws out!"
"Zoé"|"Marinette"|-0.701741516590118|" She's mainly mad at me, so I should try and reason with her."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.711382806301117|" Unfortunately, no one can reason with your sister, Zoé. Stay here, I'm gonna... try to find a way out. "

"Wayzz"|"Master Fu"|0.543651580810547|" How could Marinette have given the Miraculous to that Chloé girl? "
"Master Fu"|"Gabriel"|-0.370807409286499|" There is no way she would have given it to her. But I know whatever transpired, she will set things right."

"Tom"|"Sabine"|-0.70909121632576|" It's probably not a good idea to stick around with Chloé Bourgeois thinking she's the bee's knees."
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.496779382228851|" I'm sure Ladybug and Cat Noir will fix everything!"
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.611643075942993|" Uh… "

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.118375957012177|" Because it requires someone with a sense of responsibility?"

"Alya"|"Adrien"|0.148831963539124|"I was wondering if you could help us out with a fashion shoot."
"Adrien"|"Alya"|-0.555009245872498|" I'd love to Alya, but I have to get home or else my father..."
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.470308363437653|" I know, but you were supposed to be in Ms. Mendeleiev's class today, and since she's not here, you technically don't have to be home for another, entire hour. Your dad won't know any different!"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.321307361125946|" She's got a point, dude."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.0746281147003174|" Oh! Okay then. "

"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.755825638771057|"This one! It'll compliment the suit really well."

"Alya"|"Juleka"|0.682623386383057|" How about a little smile for the camera, Juleka?"
"Juleka"|"Marinette"|-0.691524267196655|"Uh, I don't think this is such a good idea, you guys, I..."
"Marinette"|"Juleka"|-0.78342804312706|" Is something wrong?"
"Juleka"|"Marinette"|-0.663095623254776|"I'm just not feeling that—"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.641945749521255|" You know, it was really cool of you to agree to be my model,but I can tell you're not feeling that comfortable about it at all."
"Alya"|"Adrien"|-0.169942319393158|" Decide fast, because we have less than an hour before Adrien has to leave."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.191398084163666|" That's okay, maybe we can do it again some other day, if my father lets me."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.545673727989197|"Would you prefer if someone stand in for you?This is something I should do myself, after all. These are my designs, and—"
"Alya"|"Adrien"|0.745243906974792|" Of course! Awesome idea, Marinette! The coolest thing about your designs is that they work just as well with guys, as with girls. A guy? A girl? Same suits? What do you think Adrien, are you in?"
"Adrien"|"Alya"|0.518090128898621|" If it helps."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.602292656898499|" See? This is gonna be awesome! Give Marinette your suit, Juleka— and Marinette, grab another suit for Adrien!Here are your accessories, created by the one and only Marinette Dupain-Cheng!Just bought you some extra time to ask him out! You're welcome."

"Reflekta"|"Marinette"|-0.0824587345123291|"Marinette! You stole my limelight. I was supposed to be the star of the film!"
"Marinette"|"Reflekta"|-0.68546324968338|" But, you told me you didn't want to be!"
"Reflekta"|"Tikki & Plagg"|-0.740361750125885|" You didn't let me explain!Perhaps you'll understand me better now that you're in my shoes!Nobody can escape me! "
"Tikki & Plagg"|"Tikki"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|-0.741038799285889|"Oh no, this is terrible, Plagg! How're we gonna be able to find our owners? Everybody looks exactly the same!"
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|0.175715804100037|" We have to find their Miraculouses, first! "
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|-0.68480584025383|" Paris is doomed without Ladybug and Cat Noir!"

"Plagg"|"Marinette"|0.119065403938293|"Cat Noir? Cat Noir! Cat Noir? "
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.510982394218445|" Plagg?"
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.703770488500595|" Eh! You're not— "
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.195917248725891|" What are you doing here? Has Cat Noir lost his Miraculous? Have you seen Tikki?"
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.217939555644989|" It's a long story, Marinette, uh—"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.113056004047394|"Whatever, there's no time!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Tikki"|"Adrien"|-0.623459339141846|"Yes!Ah!"
"Adrien"|"Lady Noire"|-0.290864229202271|" Plagg! Plagg!"
"Lady Noire"|"Adrien"|-0.641958653926849|"Ahh!"
"Adrien"|"Tikki"|-0.168679296970367|" Oh?"

"Adrien"|"Tikki"|-0.579775124788284|" Plaaagg! Plagg!"
"Tikki"|"Adrien"|0.00332987308502197|" You are Cat Noir, correct?"
"Adrien"|"Tikki"|0.0500624179840088|"Mmhmm. And that over there is... Ladybug?"
"Tikki"|"Adrien"|0.730610489845276|" There's been a little mix up with the Miraculous. I'm Tikki, pleased to meet you!"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.166221261024475|"Hm! Well...!"
"Adrien"|"Lady Noire"|-0.554696828126907|" Tikki, spots on!"
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.604561418294907|" Ah! Ah! Ah!"
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.301677465438843|" Well, M'Lady Noire, it looks like you're playing the easy part today!"
"Lady Noire"|"Lady Noire & Mister Bug"|-0.419920682907104|" Not so sure about that!Looks like we'll be taking on two opponents with each other's power!"
"Lady Noire & Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.587292939424515|"Ah!"
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.255950212478638|" Stay focused, Mister Bug. Use the yo-yo as a shield!"
"Mister Bug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.544338494539261|"Yoww!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Mayura"|-0.412184417247772|" They've swapped their Miraculouses!"
"Mayura"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.562890708446503|" And they're struggling with their new powers. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Reflekta"|0.598054766654968|" Make the most of it, Reflekta, their Miraculouses are within your reach!"
"Reflekta"|"Mister Bug"|-0.387271881103516|" Yes, Hawk Moth!"
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.205682337284088|" Just my luck, I'm gonna have to capture two akumas instead of one!"
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.716355443000793|" No! One akuma, and one amok! "
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.641958653926849|" Ahh! "
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|0.421763300895691|" Reflekta has been reakumatized by Hawk Moth, but that giant doll of hers is a sentimonster, created by the owner of the Peacock Miraculous!Hah! "
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.375854849815369|"Hah!Okay, so we have to find Reflekta's akumatized object, and the baby monster's amok! "
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.332852423191071|" Can you manage, or should we switch back?"
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|0.431257605552673|" C'mon, I'm totally capable of doin' it. I just need to use my Lucky—!"
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.569764524698257|"No, wait!"
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.599745780229568|" Why'd you do that?"
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.720462203025818|" Because it's too early. You don't know enough about your opponent yet!"
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.0286101698875427|"Watch out!"
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.587292939424515|" Ah!"
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.398010492324829|" It's Reflekta controlling a giant doll! "
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.711044579744339|"But you don't know where the akuma and amok are hiding!"
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.297562420368195|" The akuma's probably in the same place as the first time we fought her— in her bracelet! "
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|0.181954503059387|" Maybe! We're gonna have to check that."
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.00663286447525024|" If I could just get my hands on a mirror, I'd be able to reflect her own beam back at her! "
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.115116953849792|" That's not how it works!The Lucky Charm doesn't just give you what you want."
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|0.55255138874054|" We'll see about that. Watch and learn! Lucky Charm!A mirror!"
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|0.465495824813843|"Beginner's luck!"
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.255451500415802|" You're just jealous of my mastery, that's all."
"Lady Noire"|"Lady Noire"|-0.742480874061584|" Hmph! "
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|0.156036496162415|"Very effective, Mister Bug!"
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.578581273555756|" But, I thought..."
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.0825920104980469|" May I remind you that the Lucky Charm doesn't just give you an object to defeat the villain with? You actually have to figure out exactly how to use it to win the battle! Using your head!Now that you've used up your Lucky Charm—you've only got a few minutes left— uh!Before you transform back, Bugaboy!"
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.695269614458084|" Why don't you try helping me instead of making fun of me!? "
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.748961567878723|" Apparently, Bugaboy doesn't have a sense of humor."
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.26981258392334|"Sounds like you're wearing the clown costume now!"
"Lady Noire"|"Reflekta"|0.513813257217407|"You bet! I'm the cunning, funny, and ultra-charming Lady Noire! Watch and learn. Cataclysm! "
"Reflekta"|"Lady Noire"|-0.214429497718811|"Whoaah!What's happening?"
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.149856269359589|" You think that's normal?"
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.693289518356323|" Dunno, I've never cataclysmed a sentimonster before.It's as if the Cataclysm was like a bee sting on a bull! It riled it up without actually wounding it! "
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.634362876415253|" We don't have much time left before we transform back! "
"Mister Bug"|"Reflekta"|-0.661776542663574|" And we still don't know where the amok's hidden."
"Reflekta"|"Lady Noire"|-0.706779539585114|"No, Reflekdoll! Stop! She-Cat Noir!? Bug Boy!? Help me!"
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|0.292815566062927|" So, you like playing with dolls? "
"Mister Bug"|"Mayura"|-0.327376246452332|" Hey! You stole my line! "
"Mayura"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.494533002376556|" Should I retrieve the amok?"
"Hawk Moth"|"Lady Noire"|-0.236266195774078|" No, definitely not. Chaos can prove a good ally."
"Lady Noire"|"Reflekta"|-0.419077813625336|" Hah! "
"Reflekta"|"Mister Bug"|-0.5518539249897|"Whoa!These costumes look ridiculous on you, I'm going to redo your wardrobe! "
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.0573451519012451|" You could at least show a bit of gratitude!Besides, I think we look pretty good in these costumes."
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|0.440227270126343|" Don't forget to capture the akuma."
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|0.0510599613189697|" I've always wanted to do this!Playtime's over little akuma. Time to de-evillize!Gotcha!Bye-bye, little butterfly.Oh well, whatever. I'll just fix everything back up, anyway. Mira—!"
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.640098243951797|"You might wanna stop Reflekdoll from destroying anything else before we go around repairing everything.Haaah!"
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.093151330947876|"Okay, I admit it. It's not easy being a super Ladybug."
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|0.402425289154053|"And I admit that I like wearing your costume. It's a lot lighter on the shoulders. "
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.0946854948997498|" I'll never be able to do this without you, m'lady."
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.471871316432953|" Reflekta was controlling the doll from inside its eye. We're gonna have to get inside there and find the object containing the amok!"
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.581426322460175|" But... how can we do that without getting hit by its beam? "
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.413651943206787|" Why don't we just figure out how to use this mirror? You're a simple, straightforward guy..."
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|0.305291414260864|" Thanks for the 'simple' part."
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.508183270692825|" While I always tend to come up with convoluted plans."
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.316898047924042|" Not to say, surreal."
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|0.496044039726257|" Of course! Simple and straightforward!That access panel on the back of its head, that's how we're gonna get in. And all we need is a..."
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.39944851398468|" A screwdriver!"
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.405953288078308|" Or a coin! "
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|0.413746118545532|" That's right! Or something big and round like a coin!"
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|0.0354734659194946|" Mmhmm. "
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.171934843063354|" I would've just asked for a huge coin if I'd known."
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|-0.514628469944|" Sure, but you can never know in advance.The stick shift is a hair clip!"
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire & Mister Bug"|0.159952282905579|" You're the best, m'lady!Time to de-evillize!Gotcha!Bye-bye, little feather.Miraculous Mister Bug! "
"Lady Noire & Mister Bug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.271977782249451|"Pound it!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Mayura"|-0.694156497716904|"We failed yet again!"
"Mayura"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.104037940502167|"But there are two of us now. We're much stronger, and we will win in the end. Duusu, fall my feathers. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Duusu"|-0.370410025119781|" Nooroo, dark wings fall. "
"Duusu"|"Nooroo"|-0.364037454128265|" Yahoo! "
"Nooroo"|"Duusu"|-0.587292939424515|" Ah!"
"Duusu"|"Gabriel"|0.506258964538574|" That was awesome! Huh?No, it wasn't awesome at all.Ohh, ohh— are you okay, Ms. Nathalie?"
"Gabriel"|"Duusu"|-0.716767340898514|" Everything's fine. She's just... tired."
"Duusu"|"Gabriel"|-0.578005999326706|" Yahoooo!"
"Gabriel"|"Duusu"|-0.207529485225677|" Nathalie needs peace and quiet. Duusu, let her rest."
"Duusu"|"Mister Bug"|-0.4959876537323|" Yes, of course. Sorry."
"Mister Bug"|"Lady Noire"|-0.754859790205956|" Honestly, I understand why you never have any time to make jokes, m'lady."
"Lady Noire"|"Mister Bug"|0.484840869903564|" We both have our roles, huh Bugaboy? "
"Mister Bug"|"Adrien"|-0.683466970920563|" Spots off! "
"Adrien"|"Tikki"|0.563385605812073|" See you again, soon, Tikki."
"Tikki"|"Lady Noire"|-0.585662841796875|" Goodbye, Adrien! "
"Lady Noire"|"Marinette"|-0.454914927482605|" Claws in! "
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.45693165063858|" Bye-bye, Plagg.That was really awesome!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.462989449501038|"Sure was! No better way to escape the boredom of daily life! "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.288277208805084|" You can count on me, Plagg. I'll never take off my miraculous again!I'm not cut out to be Ladybug, that's for sure!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.347034990787506|"Aww,I was so afraid I'd lost you forever, Tikki!I'm so happy to have you back! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.165218770503998|"Girls! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.244829058647156|" Are you okay?"
"Marinette"|"Juleka"|-0.677939265966415|" I'm so sorry, Juleka, I should've realized how important the shoot was for you. Do you want to give another try? "
"Juleka"|"The Gorilla"|-0.341216027736664|" Yeah, totally!Awesome."
"The Gorilla"|"Marinette"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.00697481632232666|" Do you still have anytime left, Adrien?"
"Adrien"|"The Gorilla"|0.696276187896729|"It's important."
"The Gorilla"|"The girls"|0.345965266227722|"Mmm."
"The girls"|"The Gorilla"|0.145785450935364|" Please? Please?"

"The girls"|"Cat Noir"|0.650359630584717|" Yeah! Yay! "
"Vincent"|"Ms. Mendeleiev's class"|0.416103005409241|" Alright, everybody look at the camera. Hahaha, they're perfect! Say spaghetti!"
"Ms. Mendeleiev's class"|"Marinette"|-0.637136548757553|" Spaghetti!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.649098873138428|" I'm gonna be in a photo with Adrien! I'm gonna be in a photo with Adrien!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.461123943328857|" Right, 'cause uh– it's a class photo and you're in the same class as Adrien. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.54986310005188|" Amazing, isn't it? OH MY GOSH! What if we're standing in the same row together?"
"Alya"|"Juleka"|0.642614126205444|" Hehe, oh girl just smile and whatever happens, don't forget to breathe!"
"Juleka"|"Rose"|-0.622161567211151|" At least you're going to be in the photo."

"Marinette"|"Juleka"|-0.394860208034515|" What's this about being jinxed?"
"Juleka"|"Rose"|-0.768347337841988|"Ever since I was little, every time someone takes a photo of me, something always goes very wrong. "
"Rose"|"Marinette"|-0.742036879062653|" You're wrong Juleka, you'll see!"
"Marinette"|"Vincent"|0.693652987480164|" For sure! We'll do everything we can to make sure it goes right this time. Don't forget to smile! "

"Vincent"|"Chloé"|0.601858496665955|" Well, next row! Hmmm...You, you, you and you go stand on the rear bench, please. "
"Chloé"|"Vincent"|-0.301876664161682|" Wait just one minute! I'm supposed to be in the middle row, right next to Adrien. Preferably the center. Look, we're the same size! "
"Vincent"|"Chloé"|-0.239771485328674|" Nah, go stand in the back row, behind the rest."
"Chloé"|"Vincent"|-0.598959237337112|" How dare you, put me behind the rest? Do you know who my father is? "
"Vincent"|"Chloé"|0.471711397171021|" Is he a photographer?"
"Chloé"|"Vincent"|-0.528128236532211|"NO! He's-"
"Vincent"|"Chloé"|-0.488924980163574|" Bummer, I could really use an assistant. Now hurry up and take your place, or I'll put you up front with the babies!"
"Chloé"|"Vincent"|-0.810235649347305|" Grrrrrrr.... "
"Vincent"|"Adrien"|0.122952103614807|" The rest of you boys, go stand in the middle row."
"Adrien"|"Vincent"|-0.258728742599487|" It's no big deal Chloé! As long as we're all in the same photo, right?"
"Vincent"|"Marinette"|0.62496542930603|" Perfect! You guys are awesome! Now stop squirming and let's get this photo shot! "
"Marinette"|"Vincent"|-0.671843618154526|" Uh, excuse me sir, you forgot Juleka."

"Vincent"|"Chloé"|-0.724451392889023|" No, this isn't right! Something's not working here!"
"Chloé"|"Vincent"|-0.741725236177444|" Uhh, course it's not working! I'm in the wrong spot!"

"Mr. Damocles"|"Vincent"|-0.70291993021965|" Excuse me, but do we have a problem?"
"Vincent"|"Chloé"|-0.708601951599121|"It doesn't matter where I put him, it throws the whole picture out of whack!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.75367759168148|" My spot is unacceptable! "

"Chloé"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.52167746424675|" Uh, no! It isn't! It's not perfect at all! I'm totally not next to Adrien! "
"Mr. Damocles"|"Vincent"|0.0319148302078247|" Please Chloé, we still have sixteen classes to photograph! Go ahead Vincent."

"Vincent"|"Marinette"|0.0335618257522583|"Thanks kids!"
"Marinette"|"Principal Damocles"|-0.396251201629639|" Oh wait! Please sir, we have to redo the photo!"
"Principal Damocles"|"Marinette"|-0.558383971452713|" Why's that?"
"Marinette"|"Principal Damocles"|-0.689638942480087|" That's cause Juleka's not in it!"
"Principal Damocles"|"Marinette"|-0.261666119098663|" Jule-who?"
"Marinette"|"Everyone"|0.567576050758362|" Juleka! The tall one with the purple streaks!"
"Everyone"|"Chloé"|-0.65119656920433|" Yeah! Where'd she go? Didn't she go to the bathroom?"
"Chloé"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.737846374511719|" Uh, Mr. Damocles, aren't we meant to be heading off to lunch? And aren't you paying the photographer by the hour?"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Vincent"|-0.584668576717377|" Why yes! No time to retake, class move along, now!"
"Vincent"|"Rose"|0.645473003387451|" Ok, lunch break!"
"Rose"|"Juleka"|-0.503209471702576|"Juleka? Juleka! Jule-kuh!?"
"Juleka"|"Rose"|-0.656501471996307|"I missed the photo. Didn't I?"
"Rose"|"Juleka"|0.0542634725570679|" Yeah, another one of Chloé's mean tricks!"
"Juleka"|"Rose"|-0.711874604225159|" Why should I expect it to be any different? Nobody ever hears me. Or sees me. I'm invisible. Even in photos."
"Rose"|"Juleka"|-0.626856058835983|" Don't say that Juleka! It's not true!"
"Juleka"|"Rose"|-0.639641553163528|" Forget it. As long as Chloé's in the picture, she'll find a way to keep me out of it. "
"Rose"|"Juleka"|-0.582695603370667|" No, wait Juleka!"
"Juleka"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.6605524122715|" Really Rose, forget it. Forget me. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Rose"|-0.661143779754639|"Poor girl, feeling so lonely and ignored. How terrible it must feel that you don't even exist. Come here my little friend.Fly my vile akuma and give this transparent soul a voice and a vision!"
"Rose"|"Marinette"|-0.362702786922455|" Oh, Juleka's been locked in the bathroom, she really does have the class photo jinx!"
"Marinette"|"Rose"|-0.60377162694931|" Of course I should've known Chloé was behind this! We're gonna have to break this curse, Rose!"
"Rose"|"Marinette"|0.496509432792664|" We can ask the photographer."
"Marinette"|"Rose"|-0.484157919883728|" There's no point, he wouldn't want to! Unless, the photo disappeared, and the principal would have no choice but ask the photographer to shoot another one, with Juleka!"
"Rose"|"Marinette"|-0.715651541948318|" You're a genius, Marinette! But why would the photo just disappear?"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.577666878700256|" You find Juleka, I'll take care of the rest!"
"Chloé"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.714620649814606|"She's not ruining my perfect photo with Adrien! Think of something, fast!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Juleka"|-0.52635270357132|" Reflekta, I am Hawk Moth. From now on you will be the only one people see! No one will ever ignore you again! However, you must do me a favor in return, when the time comes."
"Juleka"|"Marinette"|-0.387271881103516|" Yes, Hawk Moth. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.0150313377380371|" So, all the material stays in the Principal's office during lunch break!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.63765823841095|" I refuse to be a part of this! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.582124680280685|" There's no time! We have to break Juleka's class photo jinx before the photographer leaves the school!Okay."
"Tikki"|"Tikki"|-0.240682423114777|" There must be another way, Marinette! "
"Tikki"|"Reflekta"|-0.667395919561386|" I knew this wasn't a good idea!"
"Reflekta"|"Principal Damocles"|0.0623084306716919|" Hello!"
"Principal Damocles"|"Reflekta"|0.140433311462402|" What? Who-who are you?"

Soon everyone in Paris will look like me, including Chloé Bourgeois!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Reflekta"|0.350678563117981|" Beautiful. It won't be long before Ladybug and Cat Noir show their face! "
"Reflekta"|"Adrien"|0.0383626222610474|" Chloé Bourgeois? Have you seen Chloé Bourgeois?"
"Adrien"|" Adrien"|0.164726614952087|"Time to transform!"
" Adrien"|"Cat Noir"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"

"Cat Noir"|"Ivan"|-0.287717640399933|"Shh!Okay, change of plan. "
"Ivan"|"Cat Noir"|-0.434143364429474|" Help us Cat Noir! I don't know how longer I can stand being in this body!"

"Cat Noir"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.256400942802429|" Cataclysm! Huh? What? My ring!! My Miraculous! It's gone!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Reflekta"|0.198570966720581|" His Miraculous! You should've taken it before you transformed him!"
"Reflekta"|"Chloé"|0.069156289100647|" Don't worry, I'll take care of it!WHERE IS CHLOE BOURGEOIS?!?"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.519611001014709|" I know you're in here Marinette. Come out, now!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.65788346529007|" Hide, Tikki."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.120931327342987|" Aha! Caught red-handed Marinette Dupain-Cheng! The principal would love my video of you snooping around in his office! "
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.684634208679199|"Stop now or the class photo disappears! Which would be a shame considering how good you look in the photo, right next to Adrien!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.586760878562927|" No!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.0449041128158569|" Hand it over, Chloé! "
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.553858399391174|" Give me that card!"

"Reflekta"|"Marinette"|0.527308225631714|" You should be thanking me! You look a thousand times better looking like this! "
"Marinette"|" Marinette"|0.164726614952087|"Time to transform!"
" Marinette"|"Reflekta"|-0.203119039535522|" Tikki, spots on! Yeah!"
"Reflekta"|"Ladybug"|-0.699517488479614|" You won't get rid of me by locking me in the bathroom this time!"
"Ladybug"|"Reflekta"|-0.451495468616486|"Juleka!Juleka, stop this now!"
"Reflekta"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.652670055627823|" I'm not the Juleka nobody notices anymore! Now, I'm the unmistakable Reflekta!"

"Reflekta"|"Cat Noir"|0.0689061880111694|" Are you sure? Ask Cat Noir. I'm sure he loves his new look! "
"Cat Noir"|"Reflekta"|-0.482382476329803|" My powers might be gone but I can't just stand by and do nothing!Who invented these things?If you want your faces back then listen up, have you ever heard of safety in numbers?"

"Cat Noir"|"Ivan"|-0.547683268785477|" Time to face off!Catch her! "
"Ivan"|"Nino"|0.735066533088684|" Yeah, get her!"

"Nino"|"Ladybug"|0.0664489269256592|" We want our faces back! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.185535371303558|" Don't worry, I'll figure it out!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.783297777175903|" Yeah, these shoes are killer on the feet, my lady!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.624045819044113|" Cat Noir?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.716348052024841|" Excuse us, move out of the way."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0940098762512207|" Cat Noir, is it - is it really you?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.192198514938354|" 'Course it is! Can't you tell by my swagger! Am I still the cat's meow or what?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.577119529247284|" I-uh... I don't know what to say!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.466195106506348|" How about a thank you for getting you out of that tight spot!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.522526264190674|"Sorry, Cat Noir, but you - you just... you just don't look like yourself! But uh... thank you!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.277693510055542|" Your welcome. And in case you've forgotten, we've got to de-akumatize Reflekta!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.609593033790588|" We? You're powers are gone, what are you gonna do? Throw your shoes at her? "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.322485566139221|" Remind me who just saved you a minute ago?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.594748139381409|" I have to find Reflekta fast! You'd slowed me down!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.0991849303245544|" Maybe, but you know, sometimes I do have ideas."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.727533519268036|" Ok, yeah, sorry, and?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.62697497010231|" I don't think taking on Reflekta face to face is the best idea unless you want a facelift too."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.41695761680603|" You're right and that gives me an idea! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.26460075378418|" Where are we headed?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.00531244277954102|" To the TV station! Here goes, watch your nails!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.790448650717735|" Your jokes are so lame!"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.810925647616386|" You haven't just lost your body, Cat Noir. I think you've lost your sense of humor too!"
"Ladybug"|"Reflekta"|-0.435165584087372|"People of Paris! Reflekta is not invincible! You can help, all you have to do is put on a disguise! Then I'll be able to spot the real Reflekta and bring her down!"
"Reflekta"|"Ladybug"|0.241771697998047|" Everyone must look like me, even you, Mr. Mayor!"
"Ladybug"|"André"|0.348301410675049|" Remember, put on a disguise!"
"André"|"Reflekta"|-0.747664093971252|" You are no match for Ladybug!"
"Reflekta"|"Mayor"|-0.634878516197205|" Now why would you say that when she's just given away her secret. "
"Mayor"|"Reflekta"|-0.214745223522186|" Ladybug will save us!"
"Reflekta"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.735525339841843|" Ladybug won't be saving anybody!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|-0.527741640806198|" Don't let Ladybug get away this time! Or I'll remove your powers!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.403393268585205|" I'm relying on you all!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.37875908613205|" And cut!Got it. Sorry but isn't your plan a bit complicated? "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.300222992897034|" This isn't my real plan. The real plan is now that Reflekta knows that we're in the TV station, she'll come right here to get us!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.287349045276642|" And fall right into our claws! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.631498724222183|" You mean, into your nails."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.707955330610275|" Still not funny. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.00983554124832153|" Gotcha!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.0411865711212158|" The akuma has to be in her bracelet!"
"Ladybug"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|-0.72028774023056|" Checkmate, Reflekta!Huh? This isn't the real one! "
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Ladybug"|-0.535247176885605|" I’m sorry, she promised that she'd changed me back if I tricked you."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.38733184337616|" Mayor Bourgeois?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.359043300151825|" There! Look out!I've already been changed so I'm safe."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.250009775161743|" Thanks, Cat Noir!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.754188299179077|" Go ahead, use that charm of yours! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.466638684272766|" camera appears) A camera? Okay...Cat Noir! Turn off the lights, quickly!Over here Reflekta!No more evil doing for you little akuma! Time to de-evilize!Gotcha. Bye-bye little butterfly.Miraculous Ladybug!You were awesome, Cat Noir!"
"Cat Noir"|"Juleka"|-0.399169623851776|" And with those shoes on too! By the way, those things should be illegal!"
"Juleka"|"Ladybug & Cat Noir"|-0.119310617446899|"Where, where am I?"
"Ladybug & Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it!"
"Ladybug"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|0.0895278453826904|" Could you take this girl back to her school please, Mayor Bourgeois?"
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Ladybug"|0.431462526321411|" Yes, of course Ladybug!"
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.0124084949493408|" Thank you! See you later Cat Noir! Bug out!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Marinette"|-0.653890550136566|" You might've pulled it off today, Ladybug but everything is not as it appears to be! Watch out Ladybug! I'll destroy you when you least expect it!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.67032265663147|" You were right, Tikki. Stealing this was a bad choice."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.572100013494492|" So you're not gonna erase the photo?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.240116477012634|" No, I've got another idea, that I think you'd approve of."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.637561917304993|" That's my girl!"
"Marinette"|"Vincent"|0.656412243843079|"Here, you can have this back. "
"Vincent"|"Marinette"|0.658240556716919|" Ready?"
"Marinette"|"Vincent"|-0.363738119602203|"Oh hey! You dropped this!"
"Vincent"|"Marinette"|-0.0470877885818481|" Ah, grazi!"
"Marinette"|"Vincent"|-0.564125537872314|" I know you're very busy but one of our classmates wasn't in the photo you took. Is there anyway we could do it again?"
"Vincent"|"Marinette"|-0.22653990983963|" Well, I'm running late with everything that's been going on and... Mr Damocles."
"Marinette"|"Vincent"|0.568716764450073|" I understand but...could we do it after you're finished here at the school? We could set up at the park next door!"
"Vincent"|"Marinette"|0.34883987903595|" Well..."
"Marinette"|"Vincent"|0.76520311832428|" We want the most awesome photo taken by the most awesome photographer, PLEASE!"
"Vincent"|"Vincent"|0.225665092468262|" Well, when you put it that way...OK!"
"Vincent"|"Adrien"|0.6033536195755|" Okay, we're all good here, ready?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.601960062980652|" This photo was a good idea, Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.306143522262573|"Thanks Adrien!"
"Chloé"|"Rose"|-0.729927510023117|" Like I'd want to be part of their stupid photo anyway! Ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous! "
"Rose"|"Juleka"|-0.803006708621979|" The class photo curse is broken!"
"Juleka"|"Vincent"|0.380964994430542|" Thank you, Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Marc"|0.304431557655334|" Hey Marc. How's it going? Where is the rest of your class?"
"Marc"|"Marinette"|-0.190773189067841|" Oh, hey, Marinette. We're done with classes for today, the others probably went home."
"Marinette"|"Marc"|0.691954612731934|" Perfect timing! Our class has a spare hour, so some of us are heading over to the art room. You should come check it out!"
"Marc"|"Marinette"|0.592013239860535|"Sure... Why not?"
"Marinette"|"Marc"|0.0347055196762085|"Maybe you'll finally let me read your writing!"
"Marc"|"Marinette"|-0.370907366275787|"Yeah, I don't know? Maybe."
"Marinette"|"Nathaniel"|0.764399886131287|" Awesome! See you later then. "
"Nathaniel"|"Jean-Pierre"|0.379153609275818|" This is a team up of Ladybug and Mightillustrator fighting Queen Wasp together: "
"Jean-Pierre"|"Nathaniel"|-0.546436876058578|" You mean Evillustrator?"
"Nathaniel"|"Jean-Pierre"|0.201412439346313|" He changed his name after Ladybug de-akumatized him and became a superhero."
"Jean-Pierre"|"Nathaniel"|0.311383605003357|" Bad guy who comes over to the good side, great idea. You should make a comic book about that."
"Nathaniel"|"Jean-Pierre"|-0.565856486558914|" Yeah, but I'm only good at drawing stories, not writing them."
"Jean-Pierre"|"Nathaniel"|0.487754702568054|" Then you should team up with a creative writer."
"Nathaniel"|"Alix"|-0.145329177379608|" Maybe... But, I don't know anyone who's into that."
"Alix"|"Marinette"|-0.20716381072998|" Don't worry buddy.There's gotta be somebody out there just waiting to meet you. Red please! "
"Marinette"|"Marc"|0.454979062080383|"Marc you made it!Come meet everyone!This is Marc, the boy I told you about! The one who's always writing."
"Marc"|"Jean-Pierre"|-0.742340743541718|"Uh... I'm sorry I didn't want to disturb you."
"Jean-Pierre"|"Rose"|0.340740919113159|" Welcome to room 33, you're never disturbing anyone here. You can come whenever you want outside of class time or after school. Anyone can create what they want, anyway they want. Rose is writing lyrics for a rock band.Rose, I would like you to meet Marc."
"Rose"|"Jean-Pierre"|0.71414053440094|"Hey there! Nice to meet you Marc!"
"Jean-Pierre"|"Alix"|0.556537389755249|" Alix is our expert at street art.And Nathaniel-"
"Alix"|"Nathaniel"|0.191826581954956|" He likes to draw people in skinny suits. "
"Nathaniel"|"Marc"|0.675003409385681|" Welcome Marc. As you'll find out, the good thing about this place is you can say whatever you want and no one will judge you, or only in good fun. "
"Marc"|"Nathaniel"|-0.118902206420898|" I... I saw your drawings on the school website, but they're nothing compared to the real thing. The movement, the expressions, the attitudes. They're all so"
"Nathaniel"|"Marc"|0.652724146842957|" Thanks... That's nice."
"Marc"|"Chloé"|-0.339480817317963|" Uh?...Sorry... But it's true, I-I've never seen drawings so-"
"Chloé"|"Jean-Pierre"|-0.759022861719131|" So messed up. All he ever draws anymore is Ladybug, ever since she de-akumatized him. As if Ladybug could care less about a guy like him. "
"Jean-Pierre"|"Chloé"|0.270301818847656|"I've already told you, Chloé, if you have an art project you want to work on, you're quite welcome here. Otherwise-"
"Chloé"|"Alix"|0.12180483341217|" Of course I've got a project.A unique masterpiece that will revolutionise the art world. Nothing you commoners would have come up with. "

"Jean-Pierre"|"Marc"|0.641548156738281|" By the way Marc, you've shown up at the perfect time. Marinette told us that you're always writing and Nathaniel is looking for a script writer. "

I'm sure he'd make an awesome partner, but I'm too shy to ask him. And I don't want to Cat Noir about it either, because I'm worried he'll be jealous."

"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.658287107944489|"With saber fencing, the attacker doesn't necessarily win the point even though he touched his opponent first. You took the initiative, so we say that you had priority. I can only parry or riposte, so I lose."

"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|0.319321513175964|"There you are!"
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.74634861946106|" Yeah, I'm sorry. I figured it would be better to escape before Riposte came along. Besides, I...... hate to be locked up. "
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.349114775657654|"I'm so sorry! You did the right thing. "
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.00821578502655029|"S-so, uh... So Cat Noir finally turned up, huh?"
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.473301351070404|" Yes, thankfully! Between you and me, he's much better at fencing! "
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.191861271858215|"And... Riposte?"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.664906889200211|" The girl is safe.Oh no! I'm about to change back!You should be the one to return that."

"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.594586044549942|" Excuse me?"
"Kagami"|"Adrien and Kagami"|0.272507071495056|" Listen, I- "
"Adrien and Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.711174666881561|" I'm sorry. "
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|0.20017397403717|"Perhaps you'll agree to take this back now?"
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.697945356369019|"No, I lost. You keep it."
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.421692490577698|" I personally think the point was yours."
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.678284794092178|" That's not what your friend saw."
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|0.597607612609863|" Marinette can get flustered easily. She's kind and means well. She'd never cheat. Today was her first-ever experience with fencing."
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|0.409876704216003|"You like her a lot, huh?"
"Adrien"|"Tikki"|0.778627395629883|" Marinette? Yeah, of course! She's a very good friend, and you'll really like her too, once you get to know her."
"Tikki"|"Adrien"|0.627215147018433|" That sounds like a good start to me!"
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|0.551561594009399|" Please, take it. "
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|0.70672070980072|"I'll be happy to get to know your friend Marinette! "
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|0.63702404499054|" My name's Adrien. What's yours?"
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|0.649722456932068|" Kagami.Get ready for that decisive match!"
"Adrien"|"Tikki"|0.682549357414246|" I can't wait, Kagami."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.167208075523376|" At least now you know how much Adrien values your friendship."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.324687838554382|"I know! Great, so he likes me. But I don't want him to just like me. I mean- I do, but, you know, I want him to LIIIIIIKE me! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.10155975818634|" In that case, you might have to work on your fencing!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.208597660064697|"On your guard, Tikki! "
"Everyone"|"Ladybug"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it!"
"Ladybug"|"Carapace"|0.146680355072021|" Way to go, guys! You're the best super team ever. Shadow Moth didn't stand a chance."
"Carapace"|"King Monkey"|-0.17121833562851|" That's why he stays in the shadows, cause we shine too bright for him!"
"King Monkey"|"Ladybug"|-0.326102435588837|"Good one Carapace!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.174418091773987|" Well, he won't stay in the shadows long if we all de-transform right here. Let's rendezvous later so you can all return your Miraculous to me."
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|0.63351035118103|" Can I come with you?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.439617037773132|" I know, I know. Only the Guardian knows the identities of the Miraculous holders. And Cat Noir, despite being the first and most amazing team member of all is now just a holder like any other."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.205792665481567|" Yeah, but you'll always be my favorite!Mwah! Byeeee!"
"Ladybug"|"Rena Furtive"|-0.170823156833649|" Rena Furtive!"
"Rena Furtive"|"Ladybug"|0.20391058921814|" You can go now, the coast is clear."
"Ladybug"|"Rena Furtive"|-0.808937206864357|"Bug out!"
"Rena Furtive"|"Ladybug"|0.581836819648743|" Another perfectly organized operation, Mademoiselle Ladybug! Let's rest. "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.716280817985535|" And perfectly secure thanks to you, Mademoiselle Rena Furtive! Spots off. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.626475691795349|" We're so good at this that we'll even be on time to see \"United Heroez: The Final End Fight\" at the movies!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.117595911026001|" Are you saying for once we'll actually see the beginning of a movie?"
"Alya"|"Gabriel"|-0.010111391544342|" Yeah, if we run! "
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|-0.110046803951263|" I have failed again, Emilie. We should have been reunited long ago. I tried everything to get my hands on the Miraculous of Ladybug and Cat Noir. I should have already combined their powers that would have granted me the wish to bring you back!I am not... worthy... of our love!"
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|-0.691808819770813|"Ladybug never makes a mistake!"
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.658857643604279|" Nathalie! You see, I've made at least one mistake."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.704730063676834|" It wasn't a mistake. I was the one who decided to use the Peacock Miraculous despite it being damaged. I was fully aware of the risk that I was taking."
"Gabriel"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.484328806400299|" A risk... Of course! She never makes mistakes, because she never takes any risks! "
"Shadow Moth"|" Adrien "|-0.599485576152802|" I need a villain who will force Ladybug to take risks, and without even realizing it,she'll make a mistake!"
" Adrien "|"Xavier"|-0.326095819473267|" Great, of course my keys disappear from my bag just when I have to go out."
"Xavier"|"Froggy's Dad"|-0.711839109659195|" Now even benches have empty pigeon spikes on them? Oh, my poor friends..."
"Froggy's Dad"|"Froggy"|-0.496096730232239|" Froggy, come back! It's too dangerous!"
"Froggy"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.754370644688606|" Why are you always scared of everything? I want to ride my bike without a helmet, without training wheels!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Froggy's Dad"|-0.302738070487976|" Perfect! Fly away, my mega-kuma, and plague that deceived heart!"
"Froggy's Dad"|"Froggy's Mom"|-0.0749395489692688|" Come back!"
"Froggy's Mom"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.139161765575409|" Froggy, come back! It's time to go home!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Froggy"|0.512812733650208|" Risk. I am Shadow Moth. I'm giving you the power to make people forget all about their fears. Thanks to you, they will take all the risks, and let you take all the risks that you want also!"
"Froggy"|"Shadow Moth"|0.500749588012695|" Oh, will it work on my parents too?"
"Shadow Moth"|"Froggy"|-0.53257828950882|" Yes. All the daddies, mommies, and children who hear your song will start taking risks without even realizing it. Do we have a deal?"
"Froggy"|"Risk"|0.261122941970825|" Yeah!"
"Risk"|"Froggy's Dad"|0.372877240180969|" Woah!"
"Froggy's Dad"|"Risk"|-0.207609891891479|"Where's your helmet? And your training wheels?"
"Risk"|"Froggy's Dad"|-0.120366454124451|" I'm Froggy, here I come, I'm not afraid of anyone."
"Froggy's Dad"|"Risk"|-0.118802964687347|" Go ahead. After all, riding a bicycle's not that risky."
"Risk"|"Shadow Moth"|0.556881070137024|" I'm Froggy, here I come."
"Shadow Moth"|"Risk"|-0.250193297863007|" You and I are going to have a lot of fun Risk, but you have to be discrete! Hide your Froggy toy wheel, otherwise, Ladybug will come and break it and you'll lose all your powers."
"Risk"|"Risk"|-0.520867049694061|" I'm gonna hide it where she'll never find it."
"Risk"|"Shadow Moth "|-0.120366454124451|" I'm Froggy, here I come, I'm not afraid of anyone."
"Shadow Moth "|"Nathalie"|-0.380523085594177|"Ladybug, Cat Noir, whoever you are, wherever you're hiding, you are now bearing the mark of Risk. Of course I have no idea what mistake you're going to make or how you'll make it, but I do know that the beating of my wings has sown the seeds of recklessness, and now I just have to wait, then harvest your downfall."
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|0.522964477539062|" Adrien, remember that you have—"
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|0.748785614967346|" School at 8:30, fencing at 1:30, then piano practice and Chinese class. But first and foremost, the breakfast for two that my father has been promising me for months."
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|-0.454596340656281|" Umm, about that."
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|-0.673395931720734|" What? Awww. He's cancelled, hasn't he?"
"Nathalie"|"Nathalie"|-0.460883796215057|" No, no! You will meet with him... but, for a work session. "
"Nathalie"|"Plagg"|-0.157095849514008|" Last night, your father had an idea for a new ad campaign. Please put on these clothes before joining him in his study."
"Plagg"|"Risk"|0.644415497779846|" Well I for one would love to have breakfast with you."
"Risk"|"Adrien"|-0.120366454124451|" I'm Froggy, here I come, I'm not afraid of anyone."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.60527828335762|" I've had it, Plagg! I'm tired of photos and ads! I don't wanna be a model for my father's brand anymore! I just wanna be a son, and be able to have breakfast with him just once! I'm gonna go talk to him."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.649426341056824|"You do realize that your father will take this very badly, right?"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.107920408248901|" I'm willing to take that risk! "
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.114563345909119|"Father, I need to talk to you!"
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.558860182762146|"Now's not the time, Adrien! Go change into the clothes you're supposed to be wearing!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.263217926025391|" Yes, Father."
"Plagg"|"Gabriel"|-0.710817456245422|" Come on, don't give up! Rebellions are like cheese soufflés, just because they collapse doesn't mean you shouldn't try again!"
"Gabriel"|"Lila"|0.416562438011169|"A girl. A boy. They search for each other all over the world, before finally meeting in Paris, at the top of the Eiffel Tower."
"Lila"|"Adrien"|0.687709450721741|" This is even more romantic than the Hollywood film I starred in!"
"Adrien"|"Bob"|-0.656657129526138|" Lila, we both know that's not true. I may have to work with you but I don't have to listen to your lies. "
"Bob"|"Gabriel"|-0.142087340354919|" Gabriel, all these scenery's gonna cost us a pretty penny and green screens and pasteboard backdrops!"
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.321912169456482|" There will be no pasteboard backdrops, Bob. I want sincerity! I want truth! This shoot will last several months all over the world. Adrien and Lila are leaving this afternoon."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.698815107345581|" What? I can't leave Paris!"
"Gabriel"|"Lila"|-0.786134749650955|" Is there a problem, Adrien?"
"Lila"|"Gabriel"|-0.658370465040207|" You're afraid of being away from your friends at school! But when I risk travelling around the world, I always stayed in touch with you all, and it only made us closer. "
"Gabriel"|"Nadja"|0.337886571884155|" So there's no problem. At the end of the ad, using CG, they will melt together to become the perfume bottle. Two souls, one mind, one heart. First Love, the fragrance."
"Nadja"|"Marinette"|0.464627265930176|" Gabriel Agreste took the world by storm this morning as he presented his new ad campaign, an ambitious project that will be filmed all over the world as an homage to the universal truth of first love."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.15191388130188|"Lila... representing... truth? Away with Adrien for weeks? It's the end of the world!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.0175434350967407|" Marinette, you've watched this 22 times already! You really need to get to school."
"Marinette"|"Mr. D'Argencourt"|-0.315586745738983|" Ah! School!Today's Adrien's last day at school and I'm running late!Ah! And I'm still in my pajamas! "
"Mr. D'Argencourt"|"Lila"|0.198622941970825|" Come on! Places, everyone! Latecomers will parlez with the principal later."
"Lila"|"Nino"|0.54469633102417|" I really didn't expect Gabriel Agreste to choose me to travel the world with Adrien.It's true that I do speak almost every language in the world, but I think above all that it was my sincerity that touched his heart. "
"Nino"|"Rose"|-0.0324424505233765|" An around the world trip, buddy! You got the best excuse for missing my birthday."
"Rose"|"Tikki"|0.743217468261719|" Right over here! Good to see ya."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.186890542507172|" Hurry, Marinette! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.709087699651718|" Adrien doesn't look happy, and I feel like I'm the only one who sees it!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.497970223426819|" You can see it cause you love him, Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Risk"|-0.034727156162262|" I've got to tell him before he leaves. ' But I'm just gonna mess it all up as usual!"
"Risk"|"Marinette"|-0.120366454124451|" I'm Froggy, here I come, I'm not afraid of anyone."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.547187358140945|"If I don't take a risk now, I'll never have the chance again!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.329421043395996|" Well said, Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Mr. D'Argencourt"|-0.388314068317413|"Adrien!"
"Mr. D'Argencourt"|"Lila"|-0.365882396697998|" Ah! Miss Dupain-Cheng! Since you finally decided to honor us with your presence, place yourself next to Adrien. You replace Lila,who just explained to us that she suffers from ballophobia."
"Lila"|"Mr. D'Argencourt"|-0.572212904691696|" No, wait! I'm actually feeling a lot better now."
"Mr. D'Argencourt"|"Marinette"|-0.667734205722809|"Oh, no no! I shall take no risks with my students' phobias."
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.274801969528198|" Adrien! I— "
"Nino"|"Mr. D'Argencourt"|0.257929444313049|" Yeah! Got you, buddy!"
"Mr. D'Argencourt"|"Adrien"|-0.266230285167694|" Adrien, to the dungeon!"
"Adrien"|"Mr. D'Argencourt"|-0.39859139919281|" To the dungeon?"
"Mr. D'Argencourt"|"Adrien"|-0.595095783472061|" The dungeon is located behind the opposing team. Your teammates will have to tag you to get you out."
"Adrien"|"Alya"|-0.058912456035614|" Ah, okay."
"Alya"|"Mr. D'Argencourt"|-0.191421568393707|" Marinette! To the dungeon."
"Mr. D'Argencourt"|"Marinette"|-0.531540006399155|" Need I remind you that the object of this match is to avoid the ball?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.320071995258331|" Are you really leaving for several months?"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.115262746810913|" That's what my father's decided."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.611926347017288|" If only you knew how sick I am of all of it, the photos, the film shoots, all these people fawning over me who don't even know me! These ads that don't make any sense? And now I'm expected to just leave my friends and travel to the end of the world for I don't know how long, with Lila?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.716067105531693|" Why don't you tell them all that you don't wanna do this?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.679861128330231|" No one would understand my complaining. They all think it's amazing what's happening to me."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.0800306797027588|" I understand you."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.40724241733551|"Well, you're the only one."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.149793863296509|" You've gotta talk to your father, Adrien."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.752003610134125|" I've tried but I can't. I don't know why. He's my father, though, I love him! I know he loves me! It's all so... frustrating! Has there ever been something you wanted to tell someone but you just couldn't do it, as if some kind of invisible force was holding you back?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.54482313990593|" All the time."
"Marinette"|"Lila"|-0.274801969528198|" Adrien, I—"
"Lila"|"Ivan"|0.172272562980652|" Sir! Since class is almost over, do you think we could finish early so Adrien and I can have time to say goodbye to all of our friends?"
"Ivan"|"???"|0.581275820732117|" Good idea!"
"???"|"Nino"|0.261122941970825|" Yeah!"
"Nino"|"Kim"|0.693092703819275|" You better send me some local music from your trip!"
"Kim"|"Rose"|0.297653794288635|" The photos of all the beaches where you swim!"
"Rose"|"Mr. D'Argencourt"|0.821067333221436|" And of the pretty sunsets!"
"Mr. D'Argencourt"|"Adrien"|0.651129364967346|" You so richly deserve to finally see the beauty of this world!"
"Adrien"|"Lila"|0.229682564735413|" You're right, I am lucky, and I'm gonna miss you all so much. "
"Lila"|"Everyone except Marinette"|-0.317922592163086|" We're not leaving alone, friends, we're bringing every single one of you with us in our hearts."
"Everyone except Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.499229669570923|" Aww!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.0807063579559326|" Adrien, wait up! Adrien!"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|-0.646588057279587|"Out of the way! Forget about these losers, Adrikins! I'll be able to come and see you whenever I want on mom's private jet."
"Adrien"|"Lila"|0.532264947891235|" Sure, Chloe, sure. Is everything okay?"
"Lila"|"Chloé"|0.794728517532349|" See you in a bit for our great journey, Adrien.Bye! Love ya!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.697521328926086|" Love ya, Adrikins! Mwah! "
"Marinette"|"Nino"|0.382808446884155|" We have three hours left to stop Adrien from getting on that train! Here's the plan. The potato is Adrien; Alya, you'll be the juice box, Rose the little strawberry, Nino the fork—"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.488467156887054|" Hang on! You wanna stop Adrien from travelling around the world? Adrien who's never allowed outside his house? Adrien who's never seen anything his whole life?"
"Alya"|"Rose"|-0.329852998256683|" It's cause Lila's going with him, isn't it?"
"Rose"|"Marinette"|-0.365182101726532|" If you love him, you gotta let him go and live his dream!"
"Marinette"|"Kim"|-0.71948516368866|" But it's not his dream! Adrien hates the filmshoots! The photos, he can't stand it anymore! I'm not trying to save him from Lila, but from his father! He doesn't know how to tell him that he doesn't want to be a model anymore!"
"Kim"|"Nino"|0.0779297351837158|" Everybody wants to be a model."
"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.278268218040466|" If he didn't want to model anymore, he would've told me. He's my best bud."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.018247127532959|"But he told me himself!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.200480937957764|" Marinette. You can't decide what Adrien does with his life, Lila or no Lila."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.596719831228256|" But—"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.499990940093994|" As your BFF, I refuse to follow along with this plan, for your own good as well as his. You cannot risk messing with someone else's life."
"Marinette"|"Risk"|-0.0759786367416382|" Fine! I'll save him without you. "
"Risk"|"Firetruck Driver"|-0.120366454124451|" I'm Froggy, here I come, I'm not afraid of anyone."
"Firetruck Driver"|"Kim"|-0.343575298786163|" Ah, driving without a helmet is so liberating."
"Kim"|"Max"|0.0379297733306885|" I'm gonna swim the entire Seine!"
"Max"|"Kim"|0.435991644859314|" I'm coming with you!"
"Kim"|"Max"|-0.739952683448792|" But you don't know how to swim."
"Max"|"Adrien"|0.264408230781555|" That's why I brought my ducky! "
"Adrien"|"Félix"|-0.321483373641968|"Félix?"
"Félix"|"Adrien"|0.725714087486267|" Hi there, my favorite cousin."
"Adrien"|"Félix"|0.552709937095642|" How did you get in?"
"Félix"|"Adrien"|-0.557057231664658|"Oh, Nathalie! There was a problem with the car so I walked home but I forgot my keys!"
"Adrien"|"Félix"|-0.678141295909882|"That's not how I talk!"
"Félix"|"Adrien"|-0.71896168589592|"You're right, you sound even more pathetic."
"Adrien"|"Félix"|-0.516963005065918|"Why are you here this time? To mock me or ruin my reputation with my friends?"
"Félix"|"Adrien"|-0.571565091609955|"Neither. I'm here to save you."
"Adrien"|"Félix"|0.570374608039856|"I'm doing just fine, thank you."
"Félix"|"Adrien"|0.387214064598083|"Oh yeah, I can see how happy you look.You don't expect me to believe that leaving Paris and your super cool, super nice friends behind is really what you want, do you?"
"Adrien"|"Félix"|-0.702562391757965|"I don't know what I want."
"Félix"|"Adrien"|-0.47747278213501|" I know, and that's why the second I saw your face on TV this morning, I left London to get you out of this mess. Freedom is something you make Adrien. For starters, you gotta stop doing everything your father tells you to."
"Adrien"|"Félix"|-0.601229310035706|" I can't disobey him."
"Félix"|"Adrien"|-0.553569734096527|"You can't, but I can. Remember how we pretended to be each other when we were little? We're gonna do the same thing. Because unlike you, I can say no to your father."
"Adrien"|"Félix"|-0.52923646569252|" I know my father. He'll never give in."
"Félix"|"Adrien"|0.349765658378601|" Or maybe your fear keeps you from seeing a hidden side of him. If I succeed, you get to go back to your school and your super nice friends tomorrow. So? Do you want to take that risk and try it?"
"Adrien"|"Félix"|-0.51839816570282|" You're right! But what am I gonna do in the meantime?"
"Félix"|"Félix"|0.332397699356079|" For once, whatever you want. You only have one life, Adrien."
"Félix"|"Félix"|-0.230099976062775|"Excuse me! Can you give me a hand with my suitcases?"
"Félix"|"Nathalie"|0.416241765022278|" Hang on, Nathalie! Let me help you."
"Nathalie"|"Félix"|0.436612725257874|" Thank you, Adrien."
"Félix"|"Nathalie"|0.449288487434387|" All done!"
"Nathalie"|"Félix"|0.612814664840698|" Thank you!"
"Félix"|"Gabriel"|-0.587292939424515|" Ah!"
"Gabriel"|"Félix"|0.441214442253113|" I have one last thing to tell Nathalie, then it's time to go. Wait outside."
"Félix"|"Félix"|0.263217926025391|" Yes, father."
"Félix"|"Félix"|0.261283397674561|" I KNOW you've got a secret, uncle."
"Félix"|"Félix"|-0.622633665800095|" Nothing will stop me from finding out what you're hiding this time!"
"Félix"|"Gabriel"|0.0149513483047485|" I knew it... Shadow Moth!"
"Gabriel"|"Félix"|-0.347431123256683|" This is our riskiest plan yet! There are so many parameters we have no control over."
"Félix"|"Gabriel"|-0.630203068256378|" No... no! Huh?!"
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|-0.514678180217743|" If anything were to go wrong, I want to leave something at the Agreste behind. I'm entrusting you with my wife's ring, and my son."
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|-0.526618182659149|" Adrien! Adrien?"
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|-0.388314068317413|" Adrien!"
"Gabriel"|"Félix"|-0.0377723574638367|" Adrien! What are you doing in here?"
"Félix"|"Gabriel"|-0.474108815193176|" I... I wanted to tell you father that...I don't wanna go on this trip!"
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|-0.0872370004653931|" Adrien! I'm your father, and I'm telling you to—To... to..."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh."
"Nathalie"|"Félix"|0.383023142814636|" Adrien, it's time to go."
"Félix"|"Marinette"|-0.0843345522880554|" Uh— Yes, Nathalie. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.310783982276917|"Of course! Gabriel Agreste is a dragon, Adrien is prince imprisoned by the dragon. And to save a prince from a dragon, you need A KNIGHT!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.690603971481323|" And that knight is you?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.235327005386353|" Of course not, Tikki! The knight is... Ladybug! No one listens to Marinette, but everyone listens to Ladybug. As Ladybug, I will be able to convince the dragon Gabriel Agreste, and Prince Adrien will be saved. Tadaaa!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.373694062232971|" Marinette, you've been taking too many risks today, something's wrong! Remember, Adrien is your weakness, and everytime you've used Ladybug's powers to solve your personal problems—"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.192625641822815|" I know it's too risky, but it's important! Tikki, spots on!"
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|-0.683888405561447|" Ahhh!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.206519365310669|" C'mon, don't just sit here! For once, you can do whatever you want! Like, buying all the cheese you want, and then eating it all! Camembert, Roquefort, Reblochon!"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.341874718666077|" No! Félix is gonna call me any second."
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.518932223320007|" Kagami?"
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.228445947170258|"Adrien, I saw you on TV this morning, and I know that you don't want to leave. Once again, you let your father decide for you!How long are you going to remain his puppet, Adrien?"
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|0.279528021812439|"But... my cousin is gonna talk to him, and-"
"Kagami"|"Plagg"|-0.663547307252884|"This just keeps getting better. You're letting your COUSIN do things for you now? Who's pulling the strings of your life? Your cousin? Your father? Me, when we were together? It's never YOU! You're only good at doing what people tell you to do! Dare to cut your strings, Adrien!...Forgive me if I hurt you. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.306112408638|"Wow, that girl is more character than any cheese I've ever tasted!"
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.547011107206345|"Kagami's right! I should have stood up to my father from the very beginning! Félix shouldn't be doing this for me, I need to take my own rightful place, and tell my father what I have to tell him MYSELF!Félix, stop everything. I'm on my way!"
"Gabriel"|"Félix"|0.453976273536682|" Safe travels, Adrien."
"Félix"|"Adrien "|0.715640306472778|" Thank you, father."

"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.565309882164001|" I should've known... he's tricked me again! It's time to end this game! I'm gonna talk to my father! "
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.0647265911102295|" Adrien! Adrien, you can't leave, I need you!"
"Ladybug"|"Félix"|-0.641012668609619|" Ah! What I mean is uh... Paris needs you! Cause you know, Paris without Adrien Agreste is kinda like, Paris without the Eiffel Tower! I saw that in the news all that you're leaving. They're all at risk of being akumatised! Talk to your father and tell him that you can't go away for such a long time!"
"Félix"|"Ladybug"|-0.568888008594513|" I already talked to him, Ladybug, but he wouldn't listen."
"Ladybug"|"Félix"|-0.691897869110107|" You HAVE to insist! Stand up to him, you have to trust yourself and not to take that risk!"
"Félix"|"Announcer"|-0.625578880310059|" I don't have the courage. Unlike you, I'm not a superhero."
"Announcer"|"Nathalie"|-0.194622814655304|" The Startrain number 5712 to London is about to depart. Please mind the closing doors."

"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.72600919008255|" See for yourself, Mr. Damocles. Nothing happens when I press the button."

"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Max"|-0.663439065217972|" That's not supposed to be happening! What is it?"
"Max"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.62279862165451|" It's Dino-33, a malicious computer virus! Let me try something!"
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.123975276947021|" Go back to your seat now, Max! Leave this to the adults!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Markov"|0.0354734659194946|" Mm-hmm."
"Markov"|"Max"|-0.545286864042282|" Inform the adults that if they don't neutralize the virus in the next seventy-five seconds, there's a 99.9% chance the hard disk will be permanently damaged!"

"Alya"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.458467841148376|"Tell me you heard Max's bag talk to him."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Max"|-0.737192302942276|" It's destroying all the school data! It's a disaster!How many seconds do you say we have left?"
"Max"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.637586295604706|" Only sixty-five."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Max"|0.588441371917725|" Let him try.Go ahead."
"Max"|"Markov"|-0.42566442489624|" Unnh! Where is it?"
"Markov"|"Max"|0.190021395683289|" I believe this is what you're looking for?"
"Max"|"Markov"|0.684086441993713|" Oh, thanks. This is an anti-virus device I–I created it with help from...my best friend."
"Markov"|"Max"|0.244707942008972|" Hello. My name is Markov.We can fix this, Max!"
"Max"|"Markov"|0.401239395141602|" This flash drive neutralizes a hundred percent of the virus!"
"Markov"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.48981249332428|" And cleans the computer's hard disk at the same time!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Max"|0.62794816493988|" Oh, fascinating!"
"Max"|"Markov"|0.40038800239563|" Everything is in order!"
"Markov"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.555728793144226|"Nailed it!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Rose"|0.754316449165344|" Congratulations young man! Very impressive indeed!"
"Rose"|"Marinette"|0.700351715087891|" Wow! Sweet!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.460133790969849|" That's so..."
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.752106547355652|" Awesome? I know! I'm so gonna write a blog about Markov!"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.544823050498962|" Dude, that's so cool!"
"Adrien"|"Rose"|0.637205958366394|" Max is a real genius!"
"Rose"|"Kim"|0.64238715171814|" He's so cute!"
"Kim"|"Max"|0.410531163215637|" You've added arms to him since the last time! That's cool!"
"Max"|"Chloé"|0.454136490821838|" Markov added them all by himself! He's the most highly-evolved type of robot there is!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.376153886318207|" Puh-lease! Your \"friend\"'s just a talking calculator! There's nothing \"evolved\" about that!"
"Marinette"|"Markov"|-0.746449291706085|" Don't listen to her, Markov. That girl is the lowest of the low when it comes to human evolution."
"Markov"|"Marinette"|-0.047486424446106|"You're very amusing, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Markov"|0.518893241882324|" You know my name?"
"Markov"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|0.728821039199829|" Of course! Max showed me the class photo. He told me all about you, and his other friends. I'm very happy to finally meet you! Even Chloé! "
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Markov"|-0.292012155056|" This toy you've manufactured is quite impressive, Max. Now, put it away, please. Come on, everybody, back to your seats."
"Markov"|"Max"|0.239747166633606|" With all due respect, Mrs. Mendeleiev, I'm not a toy. My name is Markov and I'm Max's best friend!"
"Max"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|0.117055416107178|" Markov is right. He's not just some toy; he's my friend. He's as emotionally intelligent and sensitive as any human being!"
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Markov"|-0.330555498600006|" Look, Max, a robot may be intelligent but it can't have emotions."
"Markov"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|0.781798958778381|" If I may, ma'am, I can assure you that I truly love Max."
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Max"|-0.338402986526489|" Be serious, Max. You programmed your robot to say that! A robot cannot think for itself, much less love anybody!"
"Max"|"Marinette and her classmates, sans Chloé"|-0.142883121967316|" I swear to you I did not program him to say that! Ever since I created him he's integrated his own accumulative thinking system! And he's developed all our emotions just like any human being!"
"Marinette and her classmates, sans Chloé"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|0.478791117668152|" Whoa!"
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Max"|0.137987971305847|" That's enough! Max, if you don't put that plaything of yours away right now, I'll confiscate it! Understand?"
"Max"|"Markov"|-0.0891405940055847|"Yes, Mrs. Mendeleiev. Come on, Markov, go back in the bag."
"Markov"|"Max"|-0.534734934568405|"You're not being reasonable, Mrs. Mendeleiev!"
"Max"|"Markov"|-0.379799246788025|" Stop it, Markov."
"Markov"|"Kim"|0.116766810417175|" Why? It's true, isn't it?"
"Kim"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.489671468734741|" Sure is!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Max"|-0.0392112731933594|" All right, that's enough!Max, you can come and get your robot back at the end of the day."
"Max"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.652574717998505|" No, Mr. Damocles! I'm begging you! Please don't do that!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Max"|-0.0390721559524536|" Do you want three hours of detention too?"
"Max"|"Markov"|-0.640535116195679|"No sir."
"Markov"|"Markov"|0.278551697731018|"Max, aren't you coming with me? Max!"
"Markov"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.658276438713074|" Sir, I'd like to stay in Max's class. Please! I heard you're interested in computing like Max and myself!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Markov"|0.399640798568726|" I am indeed! It's one of my hobbies. I even wrote a program for my computer which...Why on Earth am I talking to a toy? Huh!"
"Markov"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.679838836193085|" I am not a toy, Mr. Damocles! My name is Markov. Oh! Ooh!Do not put me inside here Mr. Da—! "
"Mr. Damocles"|"Hawk Moth"|0.585476040840149|" If only I had a button like this for all of my students."
"Hawk Moth"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.256220698356628|" Two dear friends who've been separated. There is nothing artificial about those emotions.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize this electronic heart!"
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Max"|-0.587850540876389|" Silence! Back to your seats, everyone!"
"Max"|"Marinette"|-0.630956262350082|"Markov has never been without me by his side. I don't know how he's going to emotionally handle this."
"Marinette"|"Max"|0.541654229164124|"Hold on. I'll see what I can do."
"Max"|"Marinette"|0.380964994430542|" Thank you, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.0559705495834351|"Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Mendeleiev? As class representative, could I have your permission to go see Principal Damocles?"
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Marinette"|-0.560473293066025|" No! You can go see him between periods!"
"Marinette"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.538591802120209|" Hm. I don't mean to be rude but I think you might be mistaken about Markov, Max's friend."
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Marinette"|-0.744877338409424|" This whole thing is really starting to get on my nerves! And your behavior is quite inappropriate, young lady!"
"Marinette"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.683259606361389|" Markov wasn't wrong!"
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Marinette"|-0.188905537128448|"I'm sending you to the principal's office right this minute!"
"Marinette"|"Hawk Moth"|0.694570660591125|" Thank you, Mrs. Mendeleiev!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Markov"|-0.287841200828552|"Robostus, I am Hawk Moth. Humans don't believe you're a living being. So I'm giving you the power to bring all machines to life to help you seek revenge."
"Markov"|"Hawk Moth"|0.562292456626892|" Thank you kindly, Mr. Hawk Moth."
"Hawk Moth"|"Markov"|0.4881432056427|" But, in return, I want you to bring me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!"
"Markov"|"Hawk Moth"|0.683005452156067|" Could you please define \"Miraculous\"?"
"Hawk Moth"|"Markov"|0.371227979660034|" They're the magic jewels belonging to the superheroes."
"Markov"|"Hawk Moth"|0.616915702819824|" Very well. What is the purpose of these jewels?"
"Hawk Moth"|"Markov"|-0.706651747226715|" Hmm?This is none of your concern!"
"Markov"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.214679598808289|" I was just being curious."
"Hawk Moth"|"Markov"|0.671307921409607|" If used together, they can make a wish come true."
"Markov"|"Hawk Moth"|0.614353060722351|" Could I make any wish come true?"
"Hawk Moth"|"Markov"|-0.0358757376670837|" No! The Miraculous and the wish will belong to me!"
"Markov"|"Robostus"|0.348049879074097|" I assure you, I will find Ladybug and Cat Noir!"
"Robostus"|"Marinette"|0.595010280609131|"Max, my friend, I'm coming to get you!"
"Marinette"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.428777039051056|"Mr. Damocles, where's Markov?"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Marinette"|0.0814025402069092|" Hmm? Who's Markov?"
"Marinette"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.224685311317444|" Max's friend."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Marinette"|-0.727115422487259|" Ah! Not that toy again!"
"Marinette"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.421533644199371|" He's not a toy, Mr. Damocles. Could you please let Max hold onto him? He won't cause any trouble. I'll make sure of it."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Robostus"|0.425838112831116|" Listen—!"
"Robostus"|"Robostus"|-0.424598217010498|" You've made a serious error in judgement, Mr. Principal!Witness my true power!"

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.430725872516632|" Now I see why Max was worried. "
"Marinette"|" Marinette"|0.164726614952087|" Time to transform!"
" Marinette"|"Robostus"|-0.554696828126907|" Tikki, spots on!"

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.679024040699005|" Aw, come on! She could've at least finished saying my name!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.600067883729935|"We'll never be able to defeat them all. We must fight the problem at its source!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.551065742969513|" Given his size, we shouldn't have any trouble finding him."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.336921811103821|" Hey look! "

"Robostus"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.563239455223083|" And how do you intend to stop me from using it?"
"Hawk Moth"|"Robostus"|-0.46147346496582|" Simple. I'll take your power away from you!"

"Ladybug"|"Robostus"|-0.788538232445717|" I'm sorry, Cat Noir."
"Robostus"|"Max"|0.593528747558594|" Max?! "
"Max"|"Robostus"|-0.698547571897507|" Sorry, Robostus, but I can't let you execute your program! I have to stop you! "
"Robostus"|"Max"|-0.503383696079254|" But...why did you do that? I was gonna become human like you."
"Max"|"Robostus"|-0.456134557723999|" I don't want you to change. I want you to be like you were before!"
"Robostus"|"Max"|-0.667441457509995|" Don't you love me anymore? Aren't we friends?"
"Max"|"Robostus"|-0.536475241184235|" If you want us to remain friends, you've got to stop this right now! I'm friends with Markov, not you! "
"Robostus"|"Ladybug"|-0.717536240816116|" I am Robostus now! And you betrayed me! I don't wanna be human like you anymore! Humans don't have a heart!And that's exactly why I've decided to get rid of 'em! "

"Ladybug"|"Robostus"|0.119371056556702|" That was wit and a little bit of luck."

"Max"|"Ladybug"|0.375523209571838|"Perhaps it's best if I don't."
"Ladybug"|"Markov"|-0.578628331422806|" Everyone can feel negative emotions from time to time. It's important to accept that, and forgive. Follow your heart."

"Max"|"Markov"|-0.468412458896637|" You were akumatized."
"Markov"|"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|0.2609041929245|" \"Akumatized\"? Could you please define that word?Did I say something funny?"
"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.271977782249451|"Pound it! "
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.144331991672516|" Are there some things you haven't told me about yet?"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.049228310585022|" What do you want to know?"
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.270940542221069|" What would happen if someone possessed Cat Noir's ring and Ladybug's earrings, Master?"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.599391579627991|" Then the bearer could use them conjointly.And with a special invocation, obtain the ultimate power. The one that shapes reality."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.635407209396362|" Ultimate power? Shape reality?! Wait, what does that mean?"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.747620820999146|" Well, basically, it can make any one wish come true."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.566328883171082|" Wow! That's amazing! But why don't we use it, then? We can ask for so many good things, like, end all wars, or eradicate poverty, or beat Hawk Moth."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.0706740617752075|" Universe must always stay in balance. For every action, there is a reaction. For every wish, a price to pay in return. Had your robotic friend asked to become a real boy, someone would have lost his humanity in return."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.285598278045654|" I hadn't thought of that."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.550555795431137|" That's why Ladybug and Cat Noir must never lose their magic jewels. The universe's balance is at stake."

"Carapace"|"Carapace, Ladybug and Cat Noir"|0.518264651298523|" Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah."
"Carapace, Ladybug and Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it!"

"Anne-Jeanne"|"Bob Roth"|-0.615232765674591|" Maybe it wasn't the best idea to bring you dinosaurs back to life. What am I gonna do with you guys now? You're gonna eat my entire food budget."
"Bob Roth"|"Cat Noir"|0.640741109848022|" I'll buy them from you! I'll put them on an island and turn it into a theme park! I'll be rich! "

"Carapace"|"Ladybug"|-0.788331225514412|" Shell off! "
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|-0.757040113210678|" Thanks!Something's wrong, isn't it?"
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|-0.461239874362946|" Well, uh..., well, why wasn't Alya- I mean, Rena Rouge, here today?"
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.347855448722839|" Oh, uh... because we needed you and... only you, and you've rocked it! Way to go!"
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|0.173118710517883|" I did?"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.745228677988052|" Mm-hmm.Bug out! "
"Ladybug"|"Rena Furtive"|-0.725476682186127|" We weren't followed? No sign of Shadow Moth's traps?"
"Rena Furtive"|"Ladybug"|-0.585957288742065|" Nothing to report."
"Ladybug"|"Rena Furtive"|0.395986795425415|" Perfect! Spots off! "
"Rena Furtive"|"Marinette"|0.275689005851746|"Let's rest! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.323730826377869|"Alya, I wanted to ask you something."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.606662750244141|" Ah, you noticed! It's crazy how my costume automatically adapted to my new role. And it gave me the idea for my new name - Rena Furtive!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.237590909004211|" Cool, yes, but secret. We agreed that officially the Miraculous of the Fox doesn't have a holder anymore. Alya, you did tell Nino that you would never be Rena Rouge again, right?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.375087857246399|" Well, it's just..."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.239783704280853|" Alya! Everyone has to believe that you can never use a Miraculous again. That way, you can be our spy without anyone suspecting."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.494545698165894|"And cover you with my power of illusion if Shadow Moth has you followed or if he ever shows himself, I can follow him. I know, I know. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.33027845621109|" For the plan to work, no one can know about it. And no one means no one. Even Nino has to believe that you'll never be Rena Rouge again!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.330019772052765|" Or... Rena Furtive?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.330019772052765|" Or Rena Furtive!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.0629259943962097|"I just don't know if I can lie to Nino like that we share everything and..."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.51983854174614|" It's too late to turn back now. Tell yourself that it's not really lying. It's more-"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.5495585501194|"It's more like you don't lie to your boyfriend. If Nino ever finds out, he'll never trust me again."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.253703117370605|" I had to keep the truth from my best friend for a very long time, so I know how you feel."
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.379570245742798|" Girls!How about an Ultimate Mecha Strike 23 Tournament!"
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.611917734146118|" Woah! Sorry, but, uh, we're doing homework, Dad! "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.334765195846558|"Again?! Your teacher sure gives you loads of homework!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.648263394832611|"And see, I still have to lie to my family. It's been months since I hung out with my dad but... we don't have a choice. We've got to protect our superhero secrets."
"Alya"|"Alya"|0.411556959152222|"Fine, I'll tell him."
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.405150949954987|"I-I, um..."
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.123320579528809|"Somebody wants to play Super Penguino!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.0463531017303467|" There's something we gotta talk about first."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.612575769424438|"What?"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.62713423371315|"Uh, I, uh...,I can't do this, it's too hard."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.793030545115471|"You're starting to worry me."
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.298750996589661|" If I do this, it might change so much between us."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.56522211432457|"Oh, no! Don't say it anything but that!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.582455903291702|" Anything but what?"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.748415112495422|" You don't love me anymore!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.420487523078918|" What? No! Of course, I do!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.128502309322357|" What is it, then?"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.277708947658539|"Nino, it's about our superhero secrets. Ladybug and I had a chat and... Okay. I'm no longer Rena Rouge and I never will be. Ladybug won't give me a Miraculous ever again, she thinks it's become too dangerous."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.506150245666504|" That all makes sense. It was so weird you're not being there with us last time. Well, it's a super bummer for sure but if Ladybug thinks it's better for you,why are you so scared to tell me? You know we can share everything and nothing will ever change that."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.741463184356689|" Yeah, we can share everything."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.411637544631958|"You did the right thing. It's safer to protect our secrets."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.312142252922058|" Yeah, it's probably better that way. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.0121181011199951|" It's gonna be time for ourevening walk soon if you know what I mean."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.357226252555847|" And while the bug is out patrolling with the kitty, the sly fox will cover them in case the mean old moth sets up-Oh, I've been meaning to show you something. I took a few selfies with my new costume. There are tons of details I'm sure you missed. Check this out!Right by the neckline, isn't it way cool?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.557039171457291|"Alya..."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.348578035831451|" I think I like it better than the old one. Oh, what if I did a survey on the Ladyblog and let people vote on their favorite?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.294391393661499|"Alya, Rena Furtive means Rena Invisible. No one can ever see these."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.31534081697464|" Oh, right. I forgot.Bummer, it's getting really hard to find a new material for the Ladyblog.I guess I still have that raw footage of Cat Noir stunts depending on how well I edit it. "
"Marinette"|"Nino"|0.70515251159668|"Yes, that's an awesome idea.Come on, let's go."
"Nino"|"Nino"|-0.168679296970367|"Oh!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.695590376853943|" Hey! Since we got out early today, what do you say we catch a movie?"

"Nino"|"Rena Rouge "|-0.231363654136658|"What about Carapace? Has everyone forgotten about Carapace?! "
"Rena Rouge "|"Nino"|0.148705959320068|" Cat Noir, forget about Ladybug. You and I, we are made for each other."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.234187006950378|" What?! Rena Rouge will love Cat Noir? This is totally ridiculous!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.312509715557098|" Hey, Nino. It's a cartoon, a made-up story! It's just made to entertain people."
"Nino"|"Ladybug "|-0.68696191906929|" Well, I, for one, am not entertained!"
"Ladybug "|"Nino"|0.574367523193359|"She's right, Cat Noir. You and Rena Rouge should be so much better together!"
"Nino"|"Nino"|0.164955615997314|" Mademoiselle.Should I take you home? Or.."
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.522691011428833|" That thing you were showing to Marinette on your phone earlier seemed really cool. What was it? Can I see?"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.73994454741478|" Oh- A thing? What thing? It was nothing. Besides, I'm just running out of battery. "
"Nino"|"Andrè"|0.499591708183289|" Hey, look! André's over there! How about some ice cream?"
"Andrè"|"Alya"|0.732264041900635|" Alya and Nino, my favorite lovebirds! What shall I serve you today?"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.462155818939209|" Uh, nothing for me, thanks! I just remembered that I have homework to do and I'm not really hungry, anyway. You can have my half. See you later! "
"Nino"|"Kid 1"|-0.414034426212311|" Thanks, André, but I guess we'll have to wait till next time."
"Kid 1"|"Kid 2"|-0.103585243225098|" Come on, Cat Noir is in love with Ladybug, not Rena Rouge!"
"Kid 2"|"Alya"|-0.227573394775391|" I don't care! I'm Cat Noir and all the girls love me!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.790325403213501|" There's a lot of talk about Ladybug, but hardly any about Cat Noir, and he's really an amazing superhero! Brave, funny, handsome; coming right up a montage of some of the most impressive stunts of a superhero who's every bit as magnificent as Prince Char-meow-ing. Stay connected!"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.0571855306625366|" I knew it! She's in love with someone else!"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|0.390223383903503|" You guys spend every minute together. I'm sure you're just imagining things. Who else do you think she'd be in love with, anyway?"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.624045819044113|"Cat Noir!"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|0.117063760757446|"Yeah, right. How about crocodile while you're at it?"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.153954923152924|"Did you see the video?"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.262364268302917|" Come on, that's just some video from the Ladyblog, not proof."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.331128239631653|"I'll find proof, then you'll see that I was right! "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.567607790231705|"There's no way! "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.270912528038025|" Oh, there's a way. Yes way! My natural charisma has probably just rubbed off on you."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.490331590175629|" You think I played the charming kitty cat one too many times and unintentionally made her fall in love with me? I have to be sure! Plagg, claws out! "
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.168122172355652|" Who would want a tormented turtle for a companion? No one could resist a kitten!This one just ripped my heart out, like a tragic sax solo and a love song. There I was, with my old buddies again: the city, the night, the solitude, the rain, pouring down,not like the tears that were stuck in my throat.It was time to end all the lies and secrets. I'd always wanted to have a mustache anyway."
"Alya"|"Alya"|-0.624045819044113|" Cat Noir!?"
"Alya"|"Cat Noir"|-0.775866135954857|" What's going on? Is something wrong?"
"Cat Noir"|"Alya"|-0.622322976589203|" No, no! Everything's fine! It's just that I saw you posted a new video about me. I'm super flattered, really, but it made me wonder: you've been following Ladybug and me from the very start. You take photos and videos, and we even saved you a couple times. What I mean is, we're starting to know each other pretty well and... it's made me notice a couple of small things. I hope I'm just under the illusion that there's something but uh..."
"Alya"|"Cat Noir"|-0.365310192108154|" Illusion...? What illusion? What small things?"
"Cat Noir"|"Alya"|-0.398336470127106|"It's kind of hard to explain, but I wanted to make sure that in all this time you've spent admiring me, you haven't built up some kind of uh... feelings for me. I mean, I get it, \"Hey, I am the Cat's Meow.\""
"Alya"|"Cat Noir"|0.578724503517151|" Huh, what feelings for you?"
"Cat Noir"|"Alya"|0.260747671127319|" Well.. you know.. "
"Alya"|"Cat Noir"|-0.575627148151398|"Are you insane?! I already have a boyfriend! And FYI, with him it's not just,it's more like "
"Cat Noir"|"Alya"|-0.692867428064346|"Sorry, that was so silly of me."
"Alya"|"Alya"|-0.0480307936668396|" Sorry, Cat Noir, but my Nino is a thousand times more irresistible than you. "
"Alya"|"Adrien"|-0.591526746749878|" Besides, I don't really know your real identity, and I could never fall for someone I didn't really know."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|0.243547439575195|" Oh, hey, Nino! I gotta tell you something."
"Nino"|"Nino"|-0.476471960544586|"No! I gotta tell you something! "
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.181603848934174|"Sit down!"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.0214594006538391|" Uh... when did you set all this up?"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.0961059331893921|" I'm the one asking questions! Remember what I told you yesterday? I got proof now. What do you say to this?! "
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.727911025285721|"Uh-Come on, that doesn't make any sense. You're wrong, that's not at all what happened!"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.430760145187378|" How do you know? You were there? You're in on it too?!"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.517356753349304|" No, no. Of course, not! But it's impossible! I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding. Alya and Cat Noir have nothing in common. They barely know each other! Alya is just a superhero fan she's been filming Ladybug and Cat Noir, that's all!"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.720565915107727|" They know each other well enough!"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.271602809429169|" But no one knows Ladybug and Cat Noir's secret identities. Can you imagine Alya falling in love with someone she doesn't really know? The girl who wants to be a reporter who always wants to know the truth, no matter what? Who wants to share everything with the boy she loves?"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.488782167434692|"They actually know each other much better than you think!"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.438211143016815|" You can't assume that from this video."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.000674247741699219|" Listen, here's what you don't know! I'm not talking about the video, dude. I'm talking about something I shouldn't be telling you. A mind-blowing secret. Alya is a superhero. She's Rena Rouge!"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.612575769424438|" What?!"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.276519358158112|" Shh!I know what you're about to say: \"That's nonsense and how would Nino know that anyway?\" I know because... I'm a superhero too. I'm Carapace!"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|0.0263868570327759|" Huh? You're... Carapace? But... the two of you know?! You know each other's secret identities?!"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.0628336071968079|" Of course, Alya and I have never kept anything from each other. Until now, though that Cat Noir's business!"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.469806253910065|" Wait a sec, I don't understand! I thought that secret identities had to be protected at all costs. If it were true, you'd never just tell me like that. Ladybug would never agree to that!"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.432731866836548|" Are you kidding? Ladybug is the one who gave us both our Miraculous at the same time."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.637702405452728|"No, that's impossible! "
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.688838690519333|" What are you trying to say? That I'm lying or something!?"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.581117153167725|" No, no. What I meant was- Okay, you're Carapace, she's Rena Rouge and Ladybug's okay with this. But it still isn't like Alya or Cat Noir to be...you know...? "
"Nino"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.0374793410301208|" You don't know what Cat Noir really is but I do! I'm part of the team! I see how he acts in real life. Sure, as soon as Ladybug shows up, he throws himself at her feet with roses and big declarations,but he gets blown off every time, because Ladybug thinks he's obnoxious, and she's right! And then whenever Rena Rouge shows up, it's like,\"Why, hello there, pretty lady, you look so fine! You smell so good!\" So yeah, it's easy to figure out that the first mission I missed- I mean, Carapace missed, he made his move and, BAM! This is what happened. Now,I'm all alone. I've lost the love of my life.If I could, I'd sew his sweet talking mouth shut with his own whiskers! "
"Shadow Moth"|"Adrien"|-0.408575832843781|" A spurned boyfriend who wants vengeance on his rival. Now that's a strong emotion.Fly, my little akuma and help this young man destroy his enemy! My enemy! "
"Adrien"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.0712398886680603|" There's got to be an explanation, Nino. We'll work it all out! "
"Shadow Moth"|"Nino"|-0.180307686328888|"Rocketear, I am Shadow Moth. Cat Noir has ripped your heart out and left you in a weeping state of sorrow. So, I'm giving your tears the power to destroy everything! All I ask for in return are-"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.455720186233521|"I know what you want, Shadow Moth. Don't worry, the only thing left to them will be their Miraculous. "
"Adrien"|"Rocketear"|-0.53673642873764|" Nino, you have to fight off this-"
"Rocketear"|"Plagg"|-0.21901923418045|"You're not my enemy, Adrien. Cat Noir is! "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.66131204366684|" I know what you're about to do but I would advise you not to, considering what your pal's got in store for Cat Noir."
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.337450563907623|" I can't leave Nino like that!"
"Adrien"|"Alya"|-0.651455760002136|"Plagg, claws out! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.464559674263|" And that's why he showed up in the middle of the night, because of this video I post on the Ladyblog. He thought I was in love with him."
"Marinette"|"Rocketear"|0.0787049531936646|"Oh, that Cat Noir."
"Rocketear"|"Cat Noir"|-0.43749338388443|"Cat Noir! You stole my Alya from me! I'm going to steal your life from you! "
"Cat Noir"|"Rocketear"|-0.653233557939529|" I didn't steal anyone!Alya still loves you!"
"Rocketear"|"Marinette"|-0.32196182012558|" LIAR! I have proof! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.671314030885696|" Oh no, this can't be happening! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.624867737293243|" Oh, Nino, no!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.691952913999557|"We have to stop them before they hurt each other. Come on, follow me! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.0651905536651611|" Okay, we can transform in peace in here.Alya, don't tell me you... "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.706896722316742|" Of course, not! It's a misunderstanding. If you could hear what we were saying, there's no way Nino would believe that I'm in love with Cat Noir."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.488703727722168|" Okay, fine. Let's not waste time.Tikki!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.337681353092194|"Trixx!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.556758105754852|" Spots on! "
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.209646105766296|"Let's pounce! "
"Ladybug"|"Rena Furtive"|-0.05305016040802|" projector) A video projector? What am I supposed to do with this? "
"Rena Furtive"|"Ladybug"|0.0940439701080322|" Do like Nino and make up imaginary movies in your head?"
"Ladybug"|"Rena Furtive"|-0.703319549560547|"You said that if Nino could have heard what you were saying, there'd be no misunderstanding?"
"Rena Furtive"|"Ladybug"|0.414793372154236|" Absolutely!"
"Ladybug"|"Rena Furtive"|0.214309811592102|" How well do you remember what you guys said on the balcony?"
"Rena Furtive"|"Ladybug"|-0.375644862651825|" Every. Word."
"Ladybug"|"Rena Furtive"|0.0575451850891113|" Do you think you could make... a sound illusion?"
"Rena Furtive"|"Cat Noir"|0.497008442878723|" Totally."
"Cat Noir"|"Rocketear"|-0.7503731995821|" I don't wanna fight you! "
"Rocketear"|"Cat Noir"|-0.685737639665604|" Silence! "
"Cat Noir"|"Rocketear"|-0.334992289543152|"Let me explain!"
"Rocketear"|"Cat Noir"|-0.729433089494705|"I don't wanna hear your lies!"
"Cat Noir"|"Rocketear"|0.310918688774109|" You wanted proof? Here's proof. "
"Rocketear"|"Cat Noir"|-0.561010956764221|" That doesn't prove a thing! "
"Cat Noir"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.385258615016937|"See? I don't wanna hurt you. Can we talk now?"
"Shadow Moth"|"Rocketear"|-0.275312662124634|"Shut him up for good! But before you do, seize his Miraculous!"
"Rocketear"|"Cat Noir"|-0.747179180383682|"It's over, Cat Noir!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.625448614358902|"Don't do this."
"Ladybug"|"Rena Furtive"|-0.128624320030212|" Nino, stop! Look, my Lucky Charm gave me a super-advanced projector that will allow you to hear the sound of the video that you shot.I don't know what Cat Noir said to your girlfriend either, but I trust him."
"Rena Furtive"|"Ladybug"|-0.358901262283325|"Mirage!"
"Ladybug"|"Rena Furtive"|0.591213941574097|" Now, look and listen carefully."
"Rena Furtive"|"Cat Noir"|0.260747671127319|"Well, you know..."
"Cat Noir"|"Alya"|0.260747671127319|"Well, you know... "
"Alya"|"Alya and Rena Furtive"|-0.365086555480957|"Are you insane? I already have a boyfriend! And FYI, with him,..."

"Cat Noir and Rena Furtive"|"Alya and Rena Furtive"|-0.692867428064346|"Sorry, that was so silly of me. "
"Alya and Rena Furtive"|"Rena Furtive"|-0.404657602310181|" Yeah, sorry, Cat Noir, but my Nino is a thousand times more irresistible than you. Besides, I don't know your real identity and I could never fall for someone I didn't really know."
"Rena Furtive"|"Alya"|0.275689005851746|" Let's rest! "
"Alya"|"Rocketear"|-0.533140927553177|" Nino! "
"Rocketear"|"Alya"|-0.344700276851654|" I can't believe I ever doubted you."
"Alya"|"Rocketear"|-0.243892192840576|" I can't believe I ever chose to do anything over spending time with you."
"Rocketear"|"Alya"|-0.75438229739666|" I'm so sorry. "
"Alya"|"Rocketear"|-0.4444460272789|" I was so scared for you. "
"Rocketear"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.304595232009888|" Shadow Moth! You can have your lame powers back! "

"Ladybug"|"Shadow Moth"|0.0668891668319702|" No more evil-doing for you, little akuma! Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye-bye, little butterfly! Miraculous Ladybug! "
"Shadow Moth"|"Ladybug"|0.257394433021545|" Love and secrets don't mix, Ladybug, and I'm sure you have many secrets, too."
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.063396692276001|"Nino, take this magical charm. Always carry it with you. That way, Shadow Moth can't get to you, anymore."
"Nino"|"Cat Noir"|-0.750510483980179|" I won't need to use it, Ladybug.I'll never let Shadow Moth use my love to manipulate me again.I guess I was wrong about you, my dude. I'm sorry. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.515674382448196|" Everyone has doubts now and then,even me..."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.488466501235962|" Is everything okay, Cat Noir?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.416131019592285|" Yeah, yeah.Pound it!"
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.271977782249451|"Pound it!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.490636587142944|" I still can't believe Ladybug entrusted Alya and Nino with those Miraculous."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.545657992362976|"Of course she did. She's the Guardian."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.0982340574264526|" But they're a couple and they know each other's secret identities."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.16982626914978|" So...? "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.18869423866272|" So, why does she make it a rule that we can't know each other's identities but it's okay for them?"
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|0.208940744400024|" She's the Guardian, the Grandmaster Cheese Ripener, and you and I are just cheese on the platter. She decides what's on the menu."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.656149864196777|" I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to cause trouble between you and Nino."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.0680850744247437|"Don't worry, I've got this. Do you trust me?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.513477802276611|" I trust you."

"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.560151398181915|" Hmm?"
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.374201655387878|" There's something I have to tell you."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.665410816669464|" Again? You sure you don't wanna just play Super Penguino instead?"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.303451240062714|"I'm still Rena Rouge.But now I'm in hiding and that's why Ladybug asked me not to tell anyone."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.251367688179016|"But why are you telling me if no one's supposed to know? Is Ladybug cool with this?"
"Alya"|"Carapace"|-0.320484936237335|" I can't hide it from you, because I love you, Nino, and we share everything."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.720826029777527|" Ready, papa?"
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.179147124290466|" As much as I'll ever be."

"Tom"|"Phone"|0.586454749107361|" My day begins at 4 a.m. every morning because the bakery opens at 7. You think that the life of a baker is pretty routine, making the same pastries, rolls, cakes... but actually, it's different everyday. One day someone might order a cake in the shape of the Eiffel Tower, and another day you might"
"Phone"|"Adrien"|-0.163826644420624|" You've reached the voicemail of Gabriel Agreste's office. Please leave a message."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.00604856014251709|" Hi father, it's me. It's Parent's Career Day at school, remember? I was hoping that you were gonna show up. Call me back."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.361561715602875|" You okay?"
"Adrien"|"Tom"|-0.335399448871613|" Yeah, whatever. Nothing new."
"Tom"|"Miss Bustier"|0.0803948640823364|" Marinette will come around and pass out some croissants baked fresh this morning."

"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|0.6651850938797|" It's beautiful! "
"Chloé"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|-0.594177484512329|"Look, don't touch!"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Chloé"|-0.736644208431244|" Put it away, Chloé! It could get in the wrong hands!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.0816179513931274|" I wonder how many croissants your dad would have to sell to buy you one of these? What am I saying? He'd have to sell the whole store!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.309515774250031|" Well, if you're so rich, obviously you don't need free croissants!"
"Chloé"|"Plagg"|-0.0338699221611023|" Ugh, jealous."
"Plagg"|"Marlena"|0.435815930366516|" Is that Camembert?Huh? Oh, that's not Camembert... But it is very shiny. I like shiny, hmm!"
"Marlena"|"Plagg"|0.0598082542419434|" Unfortunately, I have no dishes to share. But maybe Mr. Bourgeois will invite you all to the hotel and treat you to lunch!"
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.0622971653938293|"He he...ohh...Ah! Ah! "

"Chloé"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.528969258069992|" Geez, is there a day when you're not tripping over something?"
"Miss Bustier"|"Roger"|0.567336678504944|" Next on the list is Sabrina's father, a policeman. Officer Roger! "
"Roger"|"Chloé"|-0.0687046051025391|" I've been a police officer for 15 years, and I firmly believe that every citizen is innocent until proven guilty."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.766729205846786|"My bracelet! It's gone! I had it a second ago.You! You stole it!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.687847942113876|" What? What are you talking about?!"
"Chloé"|"Tom"|-0.334883570671082|" You unpurposedly tripped on my bag so you could steal my bracelet!You're a policeman! Arrest her!"
"Tom"|"Roger"|-0.660750985145569|" My daughter is not a thief!"
"Roger"|"Chloé"|-0.750334233045578|"Hold on a minute, Miss Bourgeois, we don't accuse without proof! Now, everyone, calm down, please. Maybe you simply misplaced your bracelet."
"Chloé"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|-0.63218754529953|" You're calling me a liar?! Daddy!"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Chloé"|0.532834649085999|" Roger, I demand you search this girl!"
"Chloé"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.314682722091675|" Ha!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|0.371670603752136|" Please, everybody!"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Roger"|0.604748845100403|" Need I remind you that as mayor of this city, I am your superior!"
"Roger"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|-0.648554235696793|" But sir, it's against the law! I can't just go"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Roger"|-0.620685487985611|" All right. Then you're no longer a police officer!"
"Roger"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|-0.755977362394333|" Mayor, you can't be serious! Over a missing bracelet?"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Roger"|-0.762086406350136|" This is my daughter's bracelet we're talking about! You're incompetent and you're fired! Get out!"
"Roger"|"Chloé"|0.499229669570923|" Aww..."
"Chloé"|"Hawk Moth"|0.159615993499756|" Good! Let's call Ladybug! I'm sure she'll actually do something!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Roger"|-0.0247811675071716|" Parent-child relationships can be so complicated. And the perfect breeding ground for stress. When there's no more law and order, there's only chaos left.Fly away, my evil little akuma, and take control of this policeman!"
"Roger"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.576144278049469|" Hah! He expects me to break the law? That's just, just... criminal! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Roger"|-0.0802798867225647|" Rogercop, I am Hawk Moth. This city needs a true ruthless righter of wrongs, and that is where you come in."
"Roger"|"Hawk Moth"|0.42450737953186|" Yes sir! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Rogercop"|-0.506667375564575|" Ladybug and Cat Noir must be destroyed if you want to attain ultimate retribution! You will seize Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses for me! Do we have an agreement?"
"Rogercop"|"Tom"|-0.335567653179169|" Affirmative. Cat Noir and Ladybug will be powerless against me, and justice will prevail in the streets of Paris."
"Tom"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|-0.678327947854996|" Don’t even think about getting near my daughter or her bag!"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Miss Bustier"|0.605318546295166|" Do you know who I am?"
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|0.0592048168182373|" Please, gentlemen! This is a school here! Think of the children! Surely the bracelet is around here someplace."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.41631817817688|" It probably just rolled out of her bag or something!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.608967542648315|" If I were her bracelet, I'd try and get as far away as possible from that crazy brat too. "
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.139432787895203|" Hey! Nino's been filming everything this whole time! We can see what really happened!"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.0674421191215515|"Marinette will come around and pass out some croissants baked"
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|0.343374371528625|" Well, there you have it! Sabrina was holding Chloé's bracelet!"
"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|-0.487799346446991|" Yes! But I gave it back straight after!"
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|0.121443867683411|" Chloé, why don't you take a look in your BFF's bag?"
"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|-0.602068781852722|" Are you saying I'm a thief?!"
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|-0.715506166219711|" Nope! Chloé's the one calling people thieves without any proof. I'm simply going from what's on the video."
"Sabrina"|"Nathaniel"|-0.79955105483532|" Grrr! "
"Nathaniel"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.42719304561615|" Yes, I did sketch the bracelet, but I didn't do anything else!"
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Rogercop"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?"
"Rogercop"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.572728186845779|" You're under arrest!"
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Rogercop"|-0.252838730812073|" What? What for?"
"Rogercop"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.638809502124786|" You threw litter on a public sidewalk, jaywalked and crossed the red light."
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Rogercop"|-0.566619157791138|" Well, I suppose I did. But you can't arrest me! Who are you anyway? You don't look like a policeman!"
"Rogercop"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|-0.20038229227066|"I sentence you to trash duty.Next mission: Seeking justice on Mayor Bourgeois."
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Nino"|0.31501305103302|" Give me the tape! I'll have it analyzed by professionals!"
"Nino"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|-0.730223596096039|" No way! It's my camera!"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Plagg"|-0.365849316120148|" Who do you think you're dealing with? I am the mayor of this city! Where's the school principal? I want to see the principal!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.677489042282104|" I won't bother you with the story. It's a long, boring"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.738018751144409|"Oh yes, you will explain it, and fast! You realize we have a big problem, don't you?"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.360121130943298|" If by big you are referring to my rock-hard abs? Well, thanks for noticing!"
"Adrien"|"Fred"|-0.640145719051361|"Now we have a bigger problem!"
"Fred"|"Rogercop"|-0.567105889320374|"Hey! You can't just walk in here!"
"Rogercop"|"Fred"|0.627654671669006|" I can go wherever I want, whenever I want. I am the law."
"Fred"|"Rogercop"|0.70347261428833|" Well, I'm the authority around here"
"Rogercop"|"Fred"|-0.624299287796021|" You are guilty of obstructing the path of justice!I sentence you to move around!"
"Fred"|"Adrien"|-0.288801968097687|" Wait! I can't control my arm! What are you"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.76015405356884|" What do you mean I can't transform?"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.290309071540833|" If you transform, the bracelet will get absorbed with me and damage your powers!"
"Adrien"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.532956779003143|" Ahhhh..."
"Hawk Moth"|"Marinette"|-0.509806305170059|"Mwahahahaha! It won't be long before Ladybug and Cat Noir show up to meet their doom!"
"Marinette"|"Nathaniel"|-0.291232645511627|" See, Chloé? I tripped on the bag, but Sabrina held the bracelet, Nathaniel sketched it, we are all suspects!"
"Nathaniel"|"Marinette"|-0.737280935049057|" Hey! What's that supposed to mean? I didn't swipe her bracelet!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.70037430524826|" And nether did I! But when it comes down to it, Chloé can accuse anyone and everyone!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.432295680046082|" Fine! Since you're a suspect, you'll have no problem letting me search your bag!"
"Marinette"|"Nathaniel"|0.679961323738098|" Okay! As long as you also search everyone else's too!"
"Nathaniel"|"Tom"|-0.771130830049515|" No one's searching my bag!"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.0672724843025208|" Marinette, let the adults handle this."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.761114060878754|" Papa, she called me a thief! I'm just defending myself."
"Tom"|"Sabrina"|-0.736406743526459|" You're also accusing all of your friends like Chloé's doing to you!"
"Sabrina"|"Max"|-0.224147260189056|" I'm Chloé's BFF! I wouldn't steal from her!"
"Max"|"Kim"|-0.344273507595062|" What about Adrien? He was in at least 4 and a half seconds of that video!"
"Kim"|"Marinette"|-0.347203016281128|" Then we haven't seen him since!"
"Marinette"|"Nathaniel"|-0.608544677495956|" Oh, not Adrien! I mean, why would he need to steal a bracelet? If anyone's guilty, it's gotta be one of us."
"Nathaniel"|"Kim"|-0.64863047003746|" What? Are you accusing us?"
"Kim"|"Tom"|0.279949426651001|" I want an attorney!"
"Tom"|"Sabrina"|-0.675113320350647|" Marinette, stop already!"
"Sabrina"|"Rogercop"|0.228065490722656|" We should speak to the parents too!"
"Rogercop"|"Sabrina"|0.0110867023468018|"Where is the mayor?"
"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|-0.217012107372284|" Dad?!"
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|0.442948818206787|" So that's her dad?!"

"Rogercop"|"Miss Bustier"|0.0110867023468018|" Where is the mayor?"
"Miss Bustier"|"Rogercop"|-0.578490287065506|" I think he already left, sir!"
"Rogercop"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.605746299028397|" Are you lying?"
"Miss Bustier"|"Rogercop"|-0.557551205158234|" Yes. I mean, no!"
"Rogercop"|"Chloé"|-0.567655920982361|" If no one speaks up, I'll put you all under arrest! Where is your father?"
"Chloé"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|-0.619094461202621|" I don't know!"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Marinette"|-0.35578590631485|" Mr. Principal, I demand that you find who stole my daughter's bracelet ASAP! Or your job is on the line, sir! ..."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.780830278992653|" I was only trying to defend myself! My dad's right. I ended up accusing everyone in the process. Truth is, Tikki, I don't think any of us took it."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.127495408058167|" I'm sure you'll find a way to make it right!"
"Marinette"|" Marinette"|0.133243799209595|" Yeah, well, right now, we gotta transform!"
" Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.443314373493195|" Tikki, spots on! Ha!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.705312043428421|" I thought it was a Camembert box! Anyone can make a mistake!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.272433340549469|" You're always thinking with your stomach! Wait... hmm.A bit of pepper..."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.77750688791275|"Ah, ah, Ah-CHOO! "
"Adrien"|" Adrien"|-0.195194721221924|" Gesundheit!"

"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.592078804969788|" I'm warning you! If you don't find my daughter's bracelet by this evening, I'll cut off all your city funds for the school. Understood?"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|-0.0826941132545471|" But sir, how am I supposed to"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Rogercop"|-0.7028549015522|" Didn't anyone have teached you to knock before entering?"
"Rogercop"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|-0.432367384433746|" Justice doesn't need an invitation. Mayor, you're under arrest for abuse of power."
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Rogercop"|-0.330726325511932|"Look who's talking!"

"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0891557335853577|" How?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.589100003242493|" When you're ready, my lady."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.412763833999634|" Okay, I have an idea but I still need something like... a ring."

"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.568013310432434|"As Rogercop would say, \"Justice has prevailed in the streets of Paris!\"I'd stick around, but then you'd see me without my mask and... you wouldn't be able to resist me."
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.299416899681091|" Hehe... I doubt that, but I'll have to take your word for it. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Roger"|-0.539925515651703|" You may have eluded me this time, Ladybug, but one of these days, I'll be ruling the world! And you and Cat Noir won't be a part of it!"

"Chloé"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|-0.2514368891716|" My bag!My bracelet! But... how?"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Roger"|0.340266704559326|" Roger! You found the bracelet?"
"Roger"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|-0.467140853404999|" Actually it turns out it was in Chloé's bag all along! Must've fallen into a side pocket when that girl tripped over it."
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Ladybug"|-0.749510645866394|" Well, Roger, I do apologize for being so accusatory, and firing you for no good reason."
"Ladybug"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|0.259030103683472|" I think Officer Roger has proven his excellence to you, Mr. Mayor. You'd be wrong not to keep him on."
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Roger"|0.185880661010742|" Of course, Ladybug! You're absolutely right. And actually, it's Lieutenant Roger now."
"Roger"|"Mr. Bourgeois"|0.636710524559021|" Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'm proud to be on the force, and I vow to uphold my firm belief that every citizen is innocent until proven guilty."
"Mr. Bourgeois"|"Chloé"|0.684081554412842|" Very good. A valuable lesson learned. Right, Chloé?"
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.709675341844559|" Ugh! Yes, daddy."
"Ladybug"|"Marinette"|-0.509801208972931|" Lesson learned! "
"Marinette's phone"|"Marinette"|0.627277255058289|" Check out the hilarious new cat memes featuring Cat Noir. They're purr-fect."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.153436660766602|"You're so flighty tonight, Tikki. Whatcha got your mind on?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.096297025680542|" The kwami Nooroo's transmission is…"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.415968000888824|"Hawk Moth's kwami?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.58716881275177|" Yes. He's celebrating his thirty-five hundredth cycle today… all by himself."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.066283106803894|" We will free him from Hawk Moth one of these days, I promise."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.11413586139679|" There may just be a faster solution."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.179068565368652|" Kwamis are able to communicate with their kind on their cycle, or birthday. But we won't get another opportunity for a long time. See? A kwami's cycle lasts several hundreds of human years."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.602280616760254|" Wow! That's amazing! Then… you could find out where he is. But… how would you do that?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.357329964637756|" The kwamis must gather in the Miracle Box at a specific time."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.211261391639709|" When would that be?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.370535254478455|" Tonight."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.0797891616821289|" Tonight?! Why didn't you tell me about this sooner, Tikki?!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.729903399944305|" Because Master Fu doesn't want us kwamis to leave our owner's sides. He says we have to be able to take action immediately if someone becomes akumatized."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.198506295681|" Hmm… he's right. But surely it's no big deal, I mean… if all the other kwamis are able to meet up, then it's still gonna happen, right?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.318101346492767|" Well, I'm afraid it might not work if I don't go. The more kwamis that are present, the better chance we have of succeeding!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.653635114431381|" But, if Master Fu doesn't approve…"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.576613187789917|" Wayzz, Plagg and I have an idea; well, it was mainly Plagg's idea.Plagg and I would go and gather with other kwamis inside the Miracle Box. Wayzz would stand guard and he'd let us know right away if anyone becomes akumatized.What do you think?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.464351773262024|" That's a great idea! There is no risk if Wayzz is keeping a look out."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.558683007955551|" Even if we don't tell Master Fu the whole truth?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.415197372436523|" If it means we're able to save Nooroo and defeat Hawk Moth, Master Fu won't be able to hold it against you."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.0419192314147949|" So you're okay with it? You'll let me go?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.507157444953918|" Yes, I trust you Tikki."
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|0.178869366645813|" Oh, thank you, Marinette! You don't have to worry, I won't let you down.Sweet dreams! "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.710897147655487|"I am exhausted. I'm off to bed."
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|0.560643911361694|" Uh… good night Plagg!"
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.733091831207275|" Good night, sir. "
"Gabriel"|"Nooroo"|-0.0710052251815796|" Where do you think you're going, Nooroo?"
"Nooroo"|"Gabriel"|-0.18186342716217|" I just wanted to go out… just for a little while."
"Gabriel"|"Nooroo"|-0.652161866426468|" No, you know the rules. You're not allowed to be more than a few feet away from me and no communicating with anyone besides me. There are no exceptions. "
"Nooroo"|"Gabriel"|0.00271761417388916|" But, Master, it's my birthday today. I thought—"
"Gabriel"|"Nooroo"|-0.736742317676544|" You obviously haven't grasped the rules, Nooroo. We're going to have to make them even simpler. From now on you won't be able to communicate. At all."
"Nooroo"|"Gabriel"|-0.0418905019760132|" But, Master— "
"Gabriel"|"Nooroo"|-0.727289855480194|" Huh, it was a joke, Nooroo. I'm not that cruel. "
"Nooroo"|"Gabriel"|0.64166784286499|"Thank you, Master."
"Gabriel"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.572946786880493|"Change of plans, Nooroo."
"Hawk Moth"|"Plagg"|0.583896279335022|" I feel an emotion of great intensity. So pure…Fly away my little Akuma and evilize him!"
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|0.3187415599823|" Hey, Sugarcube!"
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|-0.713712602853775|" Ugh. I've already told not to call me that. Do you ever hear me calling you \"Stinky Sock\"?"
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|-0.414741098880768|" No, but you should! That would be delightful, Sugarcube!So, what lies did you tell your owner in order to sneak out tonight?"
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|-0.0245690941810608|" Actually, I just told her the honest truth."
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|0.645511031150818|" Oh? Maybe I should try that someday; see what it's like. "
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|0.132249236106873|" Plagg! You should've saved some for the others."
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|-0.632796943187714|" True, but I was so grossed out by your kindness that it made me really hungry."
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|0.626733303070068|"I hope we can get in contact with Nooroo…"
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|0.585109353065491|" So do I. "
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|-0.597080290317535|" Are you crying?"
"Plagg"|"Plagg"|-0.64137989282608|"Who me? O-of course not! Are you kidding? Come on, let's race! The last one there won't get any cheese!"
"Plagg"|"Wayzz"|0.725235104560852|" Hey Wayzz! How's it goin'?"
"Wayzz"|"Tikki"|0.598827958106995|" Sssshhh! You'll wake up Master!Psst, come on.If you manage to contact Nooroo, wish him a happy thirty-five hundred cycles for me."
"Tikki"|"Plagg"|0.287946105003357|" We sure will, Wayzz!"
"Plagg"|"Ziggy"|0.524878740310669|" Hi, everybody. We're here!"
"Ziggy"|"All"|0.105288147926331|"Plagg! Tikki! You came!"
"All"|"Ziggy"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Ziggy"|"Pollen"|0.718489527702332|" Oh, with you here, we'll manage to get in touch with Nooroo for sure! "
"Pollen"|"Daizzi"|0.510954022407532|" Good day to you, noble kwamis of creation and destruction."
"Daizzi"|"Plagg"|0.249204158782959|" Oh! What did you bring?! What did you bring?!"
"Plagg"|"Daizzi"|0.79796826839447|" Brothers and sisters living within the walls of the Miracle Box, on this special day, I brought you some delicious cheese."
"Daizzi"|"Ziggy"|0.586911559104919|" Oh, I love cheese."
"Ziggy"|"Plagg"|0.711126923561096|" Wow, that's so nice."
"Plagg"|"Ziggy"|-0.617449283599854|" Unfortunately, I had to sacrifice it on the way here, to feed a poor, starving kitten."
"Ziggy"|"Daizzi"|0.611599087715149|" Oh, that's just so cute."
"Daizzi"|"Tikki"|0.478718519210815|" What about you, Tikki?"
"Tikki"|"Daizzi"|0.645658254623413|" From my owner's home, I bring you this."
"Daizzi"|"??? kwami"|0.71670138835907|" Yeah! Oh, what a jewel, what a jewel!"
"??? kwami"|"Roaar"|0.6651850938797|" It's beautiful!"

"Sass"|"Tikki"|0.695195555686951|" It is a good thing you are here. Your owners were wise to give you permission to come."
"Tikki"|"Sass"|0.40690004825592|" Yes, Sass. Marin— "
"Sass"|"Plagg"|0.285383462905884|" Your owner?"
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|-0.000897526741027832|" Hahaha, you forgot about the magic spell! We can't say our owner's names to each other, remember?"
"Tikki"|"Sass"|0.71185040473938|" Yes. My owner is the best Ladybug I've ever served."
"Sass"|"Plagg"|0.701599836349487|" We are also very lucky that the guardian of the Miracle Box agreed to it too."
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|0.626108646392822|" Well… shall we dance, Tikki? We have to properly celebrate our friend Nooroo after all. "
"Marinette"|"Nightmare Adrien"|-0.291763961315155|"Adrien… A house… three kids and a cat. Nah, forget the cat; a hamster."

"Plagg"|"Sass"|-0.0727688074111938|" What if we brought Wayzz in?"
"Sass"|"Wayzz"|-0.173791766166687|" We won't have another opportunity to contact Nooroo until his next birthday. Go get him!"
"Wayzz"|"Plagg"|-0.235683023929596|"Mm-mm. I have to stand guard."
"Plagg"|"Wayzz"|-0.110683262348175|" But this could be our only chance of finding Nooroo… and Hawk Moth!"

"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.717620342969894|" Huh… Marinette?!Wha… what-a…"
"Marinette"|"Ghosts of The Guardians"|0.282221555709839|" Quick, Master.Don't stay here."
"Ghosts of The Guardians"|"Master Fu"|-0.512856841087341|" Fu! We are the ghosts of The Order of The Guardians of The Miraculous. You caused our downfall and lost two Miraculous!"

"Ghosts of The Guardians"|"Master Fu"|-0.73017492890358|" Yes, it was your fault. Your fault. Your fault. Your fault."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.0480661988258362|" Marinette, transform!"

"Master Fu"|"Adrien"|-0.751437842845917|" This is disastrous, Marinette. There's no way of communicating with the kwamis when they are in their magic world. "

"Hawk Moth"|"Fluff"|0.200435161590576|" A-ha! It's me who's going to find you, little kwamis! And I will make you my slaves, just like Nooroo!"
"Fluff"|"Barkk"|0.690558671951294|" His will is so powerful!"
"Barkk"|"Wayzz"|-0.651135295629501|" We must cut off all communication! Hawk Moth is trying to track us down!"
"Wayzz"|"Ziggy"|-0.634421795606613|" Hey, wait. The reason we can't speak to Nooroo is because he's powering Hawk Moth right now. Which means Hawk Moth's probably akumatized someone!"
"Ziggy"|"Kaalki"|0.435811758041382|" And since Plagg and Tikki are here with us…"
"Kaalki"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.691419303417206|" Ladybug and Cat Noir aren't able to transform.Go and find your owners right away! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Sandboy"|-0.641674548387527|"They're making a serious mistake. I just felt the kwamis somewhere on the right bank of the Seine. Find them! Capture them!"

"Nightmare Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.0434979200363159|" —hortensias, roses and Chloés. "
"Plagg"|"Tikki"|-0.0434836745262146|" I'd better go find him. I just hope he's not living a nightmare without me around. Ooh— "

"Wayzz"|"Master Fu"|-0.645287752151489|" I'm sorry, Master, we should've warned you."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.288526773452759|" We'll talk about it later, Wayzz!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.693876892328262|" Right now, we have to end this nightmare!"

"Sandboy"|"Hawk Moth"|0.397237181663513|" Kwami in sight."
"Hawk Moth"|"Sandboy"|0.345262169837952|"That's Cat Noir's kwami. Capture it or follow it all the way to its owner. "

"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.632015615701675|" Plagg! I'm so relieved you're not a sock, but you better have a good excuse."

"Santa"|"Adrien"|-0.648937791585922|" Fine. Don't worry, I'm a tough old Santa. But, what are you doing out at this time of night? Are you lost? You're not exactly dressed for the cold weather. Maybe you'd like some hot chocolate, I've got some left."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.703125238418579|" Yeah, I'd love some, Sir, doesn't get much better than that."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.6802758872509|" Ahem!"
"Adrien"|"Santa"|-0.535262316465378|" Except maybe a slice of Camembert?"
"Santa"|"Adrien"|-0.449026167392731|" Oh you're in luck! I've still got some sandwich leftover. This is some of the smelliest cheese I've ever come across."
"Adrien"|"Santa"|0.773013472557068|" Hmm, that smells… perfect."
"Santa"|"Adrien"|-0.157525837421417|"To each it's own. So you're not lost then, I hope."
"Adrien"|"Santa"|-0.172074794769287|" It's my first Christmas without my mom, sir. And my father…"
"Santa"|"Adrien"|-0.405563533306122|" Doesn't know how to move on? I understand. But your dad must be wondering where you are, you know. He must be very worried about you. Now that you've gotten out of the house and cleared your thoughts a bit, don't you think it'd be a good idea to go home?"
"Adrien"|"Santa"|0.227402567863464|" Yeah, you're right."
"Santa"|"Adrien"|0.697289943695068|" Atta boy, that's what Christmas is all about. Families together. I'll take you there on my sleigh ."

"Santa"|"Adrien"|-0.560151398181915|" Hmm?"
"Adrien"|"Santa"|0.32168185710907|" The friend who gave it to me would want you to have it."
"Santa"|"Adrien"|0.730974674224854|" A present, for me?"
"Adrien"|"Santa"|0.57199764251709|" Everyone deserves a Christmas present."
"Santa"|"Ladybug"|0.512110114097595|" Thanks a lot, son."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.132155239582062|"There is only one thing this kind of damage can bring, Cat Noir's Cataclysm, am I right? And look this gift wrap too, it's an important clue, it's from my present to Adrien tonight. Adrien disappears, and Cat Noir steps in, he must be working to protect him. My only explanation, my speculation, is that some supervillain is after Adrien. It's a good thing I'm here, I'll protect him without fear, this boy that I secretly love. Now with all of my might, I'll save you tonight, you're the boy that I secretly love. If you'll never know it's true, I'll be there for you, you're the boy that I secretly love. But what would you do if you knew what's true, that's why I so secretly love you. "
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.0149901509284973|" Who could possibly been akumatized on Christmas Eve? Footsteps."
"Adrien"|"Santa"|0.724562406539917|" How about you, sir? Where will you be celebrating Christmas?"
"Santa"|"Adrien"|-0.380078732967377|" Me? I have all of Paris. The whole world even! Ho, ho, ho!"
"Adrien"|"Santa"|0.516731023788452|" All by yourself, huh? Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Take me back home and have Christmas with us! I need you to bring the Christmas spirit back into our home."
"Santa"|"Adrien"|-0.638001352548599|" All right then. But I can't stay for too long, you do know that Santa's very busy at Christmas time."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.612814664840698|" Thank you!"
"Gabriel"|"Santa"|0.461190819740295|" Adrien, is that you? Who are you?"
"Santa"|"Gabriel"|-0.106149971485138|" Isn't it obvious? I'm Santa Claus!"
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.182231903076172|" Really now? That would make me the Easter Bunny. You're here for money, I suppose? I'll get my bodyguard to deal with you."
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.652024805545807|" No, you're wrong, father!"
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.488142967224121|"No, he's not. Your father's got the right idea. He's a supervillain under Hawk Moth's control."
"Adrien"|"Santa"|-0.612575769424438|" What?"
"Santa"|"Adrien"|-0.338448762893677|" You're all totally crazy!"
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.68341937661171|" What? No, Ladybug stop! That man hasn't been akumatized!"
"Ladybug"|"Santa"|-0.106797635555267|" I know when I'm looking at an akuma victim, trust me."

"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.420080423355103|" Yeah, okay."
"Ladybug"|"Santa"|-0.671529501676559|" You… So you're not a supervillain?"
"Santa"|"Ladybug"|-0.608227968215942|" Of course I'm not! I think you've been reading too many comic books, young lady."

"Hawk Moth"|"Santa"|-0.214548945426941|" Well, I believe in you. Santa Claws, I am Hawk Moth. They wrongly accused you of being a supervillain, so that's what you'll get to be from now on.

"Alya"|"Ella and Etta"|-0.442483961582184|" Come on, bedtime, you little monsters! That's enough mischief for one day! "
"Ella and Etta"|"Alya"|-0.62826082110405|" It's not us! It's the Sapotis! "
"Alya"|"Etta"|-0.333314776420593|" Off to bed, little Sapotis. You need to rest if you wanna be fighting fit for tomorrow."
"Etta"|"Ella"|-0.735775589942932|" It's not fair! We don't wanna go to bed! We wanna stay up with you!"
"Ella"|"Alya"|0.662042737007141|" Yeah! We wanna watch the movie and tell each other lots of secrets!"
"Alya"|"Alya"|-0.137874126434326|" And what kind of zombies will you be at the amusement park tomorrow if you go to bed late? Show 'em, Marinette!"
"Alya"|"Ella and Etta"|0.254328727722168|" So what's it gonna be? Boring sit-down pajama party with the big kids, or... the super fun cool amusement park tomorrow?"
"Ella and Etta"|"Alya"|0.0990580320358276|" The amusement park! "
"Alya"|"Ella"|0.379197597503662|" That's what I thought. So, goodnight, Sapotis. "
"Ella"|"Alya"|0.226069450378418|" Wait! Can we keep 'em on? Please?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.364926099777222|" All right. But go to sleep now. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.254872620105743|"You seriously have a technique down with your little sisters. But... uh, who are the Sapa... Sapo...?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.095704197883606|" The Sapotis? They're little monsters from a créole fable... who are always pulling pranks and making all sorts of mischief.Now that we're all alone I can finally tell you.Apparently Ladybug has been around at least since the pharaohs. But no way can the Ladybug we know can be five thousand years old! So, I downloaded a great app that analyzed some recordings I had of her talking. Based on the frequencies of her voice, it turns out she's a girl our age!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.0451263189315796|" Euhh..Uh...Alya? The orange juice?"
"Alya"|"Ella and Etta"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Ella and Etta"|"Alya"|-0.62826082110405|" It's not us! It's the Sapotis!"

"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.0639938116073608|"Uhh...We were about to watch a movie! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.514295935630798|" Oh, yeah! Ladybug! She's like a high school girl. So to figure out who she really is, all we need to do is to find a girl our age who's always late—"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.181678831577301|"Don't you think there's a reason why she keeps her identity a secret?"
"Alya"|"Ella and Etta"|0.242712020874023|"All right, that's enough! Get out of bed one more time, and no one'll be going to the amusement park tomorrow!"
"Ella and Etta"|"Alya"|-0.663860678672791|"It's not us! It's the Sa—"
"Alya"|"Alya"|-0.598479509353638|" This is your last warning! No! Joke!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.583683401346207|" What were you saying about her secret identity?"
"Marinette"|"Ella and Etta"|0.328735947608948|" Ladybug needs it to protect her family and friends. Otherwise the villains could use them to get to her."
"Ella and Etta"|"Alya"|-0.677216172218323|" It's not us! It's the—!"
"Alya"|"Ella and Etta"|0.436391115188599|" That's it! "
"Ella and Etta"|"Alya"|-0.732449918985367|" Come on, Alya! We won't do it again!"
"Alya"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.379193603992462|" Yeah? Well, it's too late!We'll all go to the park when you can behave, some other day! Now go to sleep!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Alya"|-0.709969311952591|" \"I don't want another peep out of you!\", \"Wash your hands!\", \"Clean your room!\". Kids should be able to do whatever they want to do, however they want to do it.Fly, my little evil one and akumatize them! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.409175038337708|" Well, if I knew who Ladybug really was, I'd keep it a secret. I would even help her! Like say, if you were Ladybug, I'd cover for you — when you needed to transform in school, go fight the \"baddies\", you know?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.523467898368835|" Oh yeah? Well, if I was Ladybug I wouldn't even tell you, to protect you from the \"baddies\", you know?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.0366206169128418|" You serious? If I was Ladybug, I'd totally tell you! Because I tell my best friend everything."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.321906507015228|" You're right, Alya. You should always tell your best friend everything. So come on. Spill the beans. Are you actually Ladybug?"
"Alya"|"Etta"|-0.17518562078476|" Right. Like I'm telling you. Nuh-uh. "
"Etta"|"Ella"|0.645589113235474|" It's mine!"
"Ella"|"Etta"|-0.169475257396698|" No, this one's mine!"
"Etta"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.192523419857025|" No, it's mine!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Ella and Etta"|0.504464387893677|"Sapotis, I am Hawk Moth. Your big sister's telling you what to do? Well, I'll let you be asmischievousas you want!"
"Ella and Etta"|"Hawk Moth"|0.635285019874573|" 'And do whatever we want? Like, stay up all night! And go to the movies? And eat lots of desserts? And drink orange juice?! And still go to the amusement park?!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Ella and Etta"|-0.633990883827209|" Yes, yes, but calm down! From now on, no one will ever be able to punish you, because it will always be another Sapoti's fault. All you have to do is to take Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous, and give them to your good friend, Hawk Moth. Okay?"
"Ella and Etta"|"Alya"|0.48602294921875|" Okay! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.715874671936035|" That's it! I've totally had it with these kids!Don't even try to blame this on the—Sapotis?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.774980172514915|" Maybe you were a little too strict with them."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.741335242986679|" Normally when you're firm with kids they don't turn into monsters!"
"Marinette"|"Sapoti"|0.338396191596985|" They're multiplying after they eat!AAH!"

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.236369550228119|" I...uh... Trial and error."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.637212991714478|" But no akuma's been released!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.489126265048981|" No, 'cause that monster was a clone!These Sapotis multiply every time they eat. To get to the akuma, we'll have to destroy the original one — the very first one Hawk Moth akumatized."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.00732362270355225|" So you mean we'vegotta catch 'em all. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.479670345783234|" Come on! I thought you liked a good challenge!"

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.527613878250122|" A teapot?"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.44805121421814|" It's strangely familiar."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.707691580057144|" It's weird. I can't find anything!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.377138257026672|" Hurry up! My kung-fu's not enough!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.666496396064758|"Of course! I know someone who can help! Gotta go! "

"Ladybug"|"Sapotis"|-0.405283451080322|" No, it can't. You've gotta trust me on this one."
"Sapotis"|"Cat Noir"|0.711430788040161|" Miraculous!"
"Cat Noir"|"Master Fu"|0.164196491241455|"Go on, M'Lady!"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.498506546020508|"Mmm. It's open."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.157893896102905|"Hello, Master Fu."
"Master Fu"|"Wayzz"|0.178997755050659|" Hello, Marinette."
"Wayzz"|"Master Fu"|-0.614435970783234|"Marinette? But you're not supposed to come to Master Fu's place!"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.186580538749695|" Let her talk, Wayzz."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.126106142997742|" Master, I used my Lucky Charm, but strangely, I think it was a hint which was telling me to come here in a way."
"Master Fu"|"Wayzz"|-0.26397317647934|" I see."
"Wayzz"|"Master Fu"|-0.560151398181915|" Hmm?"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.236740112304688|" Marinette, I taught you all about the Miraculous and their powers. You know that yours works in a very mysterious way. I think it's trying to tell us that you need help this time.I don't know if it's safe. I already took an enormous risk by putting two Miraculous into circulation."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.234419465065002|" And you were right to do it. Cat Noir and I are very careful."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.699262976646423|" Hmmm.Marinette, pick an ally you can trust to fight alongside you in this mission."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.36022675037384|" Wow!"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.462232708930969|" Choose wisely. Such powers are meant to serve the greater good. They must never get into the wrong hands."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.280043363571167|" Like Hawk Moth's."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.168999910354614|" Yes. Once the mission is over, you must retrieve the Miraculous from them and bring it back to me. Until we've unlocked all the secrets of the spellbook, it's too dangerous to allow any more Miraculous to be out in the open for very long."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.345965266227722|" Mmm."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.482845187187195|" Is there anyone you can think of, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.720142960548401|" Yes, Master. I know just the right person!"
"Master Fu"|"Alya"|0.345965266227722|"Mmm."
"Alya"|"Alya"|-0.195469796657562|" Listen! We can renegotiate the amusement park idea if you want, 'kay? But first, I need you to chill out and come back home with me."

"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.393923282623291|"Me? Help you superheroes? You bet I am! Just wait till I tell Marinette about this! "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.44285261631012|"Hold on now. This has to be a secret. Not a word to your friends or on the Ladyblog."
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.517099916934967|" Oh, right.Understood."
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.599244475364685|"Alya Césaire, here is the Miraculous of the fox, which grants the power of illusion. You will use it for the greater good.Once the job is done, you will return the Miraculous to me. Can I trust you?"

"Trixx"|"Ladybug"|0.195462703704834|"Not bad."

"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.734942257404327|" Sorry, Ladybug. "
"Ladybug"|"Trixx"|0.525736808776855|" Ready to become a superhero?"

"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.707716315984726|"I had a nightmare. It was horrible! Alya told everyone, everything and Shadow Moth had hold of the Miracle Box."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.709263533353806|" Whew."
"Tikki"|"Wayzz"|-0.334149122238159|" It was just a bad dream, that wouldn't really happen. Alya is a loyal friend."
"Wayzz"|"Xuppu"|-0.686324685811996|" Alya is. But her kwami, Trixx, can't help making mischief whenever is facing to whom."

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.69317352771759|" Shhh."

"Nora"|"Ella"|0.214337944984436|" If I find him, he better be ready for a good old roundhouse kick!"
"Ella"|"Etta"|0.1456458568573|" First one who finds the furry squishy gets to keep it."
"Etta"|"Otis"|0.261122941970825|" Yeah!"
"Otis"|"Marinette"|-0.382321715354919|" I can't believe this, it's like the little monster can go through walls or something."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.0994607210159302|" Everyone knows? You-you told them?!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.564529210329056|" Well, I had to since I lost him. Imagine what happened if someone could cross him or worse if he escaped. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.736701995134354|" You lost him?"
"Alya"|"Marlena"|-0.749548077583313|" Yeah, so? Everybody loses things from time to time. Help me look instead of lecturing me."
"Marlena"|"Marinette"|0.760753035545349|" Stay for lunch, Marinette. You let me know, how you like my Colombo, okay?"
"Marinette"|"Marlena"|-0.689542174339294|"A T-T-T-Tarantula! ."

"Otis"|"Nino"|-0.0953727960586548|" Seems like he got his legs working again. Tomorrow, it's back to the zoo, buddy."
"Nino"|"Nora"|0.503943920135498|"Is it okay to come out now?"
"Nora"|"Nino"|-0.680509746074677|"Ha! You flyweights, Cappy was scared of the itsy-bitsy spider, just like you, baguette!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.699603587388992|"Nah, I wasn't scared, I just went into the bathroom to make sure that Hannibal had not fallen into the toilet.But why are you in your pajamas?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.577466368675232|" Cute look, Marinette. So, are you here for anything... specific?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.689266085624695|"Oh! No, it's cool! Nothing specific, especially now I've seen you found the tarantula, I'm so relieved it wasn't something else that you'd lost. "
"Alya"|"Nora"|-0.199156999588013|" Ah, I know what thing you're talking about, FYI, when someone trusts me with a \"thing,\" I don't lose it."
"Nora"|"Marinette"|-0.593632221221924|"Look who's talking! You're the one who just lost Hannibal."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.144061923027039|" Huh. Can we chat for a sec? "
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.621484071016312|" Sorry, Nino. This is between Marinette and me. "
"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.278039038181305|"Ahh! Haha, haha ."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.416357755661011|"I swear, it was so... lifelike!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.749206602573395|" It was just a nightmare, Marinette. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.441325783729553|" Everyone knew that I was...you-know-who, you know?AAAAHHH!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.439523220062256|" Chill out, everything's cool!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.267865657806396|"Okay. We know that Shadow Moth has identified some of the holders. He knows you've been Rena Rouge! What if he found out I left the Miraculous with you? He could steal it from you!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.318626880645752|" Shadow Moth or anybody else will never know! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.596889913082123|" Not even Cat Noir can!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.109273195266724|" No one's gonna find this!And thanks to this very hip bag my BFF gave me,Trixx is always with me, out of sight."
"Marinette"|"Trixx"|-0.532403737306595|" Trixx! Promise you're not gonna... make any mischief like popping up at the table during lunch, for example? "
"Trixx"|"Tikki"|-0.401586771011353|" As silent as a phoenix and as wily as foxes. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.202443540096283|"I told you everything is alright!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.669251590967178|" I was silly to worry. You're right."
"Alya"|"Alya"|-0.292656779289246|" Trust me, and trust yourself! You were right to give me a Mirac-Ugh, seriously? Hello?? Why isn't anybody getting that? "
"Alya"|"Shadow Moth"|0.173435091972351|" Hey! Where'd you guys all go? Is this some kind of joke?Hello?"
"Shadow Moth"|"Alya"|0.284685969352722|"Rena Rouge, I am Shadow Moth."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette! "

"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.315210938453674|" Alya! Be careful! "
"Alya"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.656683743000031|" Nino! Seriously? Don't tell me you got akumatized into Bubbler again just 'cause I didn't let you in my room!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Sentibubbler"|-0.549203217029572|"I'm not Nino, I'm the Sentibubbler."
"Sentibubbler"|"Nino"|-0.293279886245728|" Nino is with your family, all prisoners!"

"Nora"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.503623843193054|"Don't panic, the Beetle and Mr. Whiskers will save us!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Alya"|-0.282330572605133|"You've probably realized by nowthat you'll have to obey me if you want to see your loved ones again. "
"Alya"|"Shadow Moth"|0.135632157325745|" What do you want, Shadow Moth?"
"Shadow Moth"|"Marinette"|-0.328672587871552|"I want you to betray Ladybug!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.782528802752495|" This is worse than a nightmare! Tikki, I can't transform or everyone will see me!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.409916579723358|" Alya will figure something out. That's why you left her a Miraculous!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.512954205274582|"I have to tell her that the villain is probably a sentimonster!Rena Rouge has to warn Cat Noir that he must not cataclysm him, or the sentimonster will get out of control and our bubbles could pop out!"
"Alya"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.586760878562927|" No!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Marinette"|0.400366067886353|"The only people you'll be able to communicate with now, Alya Césaire, are me and my sentimonster!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.664005517959595|"Why isn't she answering?Oh no. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.14025890827179|" Trust Alya, Marinette. She's never let you down before!"
"Marinette"|"Nadja Chamack"|-0.160439193248749|" You're right! Besides, I'm sure Cat Noir will show up soon! "
"Nadja Chamack"|"Plagg"|-0.610209614038467|"These bubbles are floating for over five minutes now, and still no superhero in sight. Isn't that right, Clara?"
"Plagg"|"Clara Contard"|-0.369513034820557|"Aww, this cheese isn't runny enough yet."
"Clara Contard"|"Nadja"|0.146349787712097|"Yes, Nadja, and no villain either. In fact, these bubbles are identical to the ones created by the Bubbler. Yet, in one of them, there's Nino Lahiffe, the student that was originally akumatized as the Bubbler."
"Nadja"|"Adrien"|-0.155698537826538|"Keep your distance, Clara. Don't take any risks until Ladybug and Cat Noir get there."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.508773982524872|"Nino! Marinette!Plagg?"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.360763072967529|"Well, good! By the time we're back, maybe this cheese will become edible!"
"Adrien"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out! "
"Shadow Moth"|"Alya"|0.508924007415771|" Listen carefully. Ladybug will be here any minute. And since it's your family and friends, Ladybug will ask you to help her, and hand you the Miraculous of the Fox. Once she's given you the Miraculous, the Sentibubbler will be hiding nearby and capture Ladybug!"
"Alya"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.435474038124084|" Cat Noir will come to save her!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.107798755168915|" No. He won't even know she's been captured. Because thanks to your Miraculous, you'll transform into Rena Rouge and create an illusion of Ladybug and Rena Rouge to distract Cat Noir. Thinking he's joined his fellow heroes, he won't notice the Sentibubbler until it's too late, and you'll give me your Miraculous! It is then and only then when the three Miraculous are finally in my possession! That, the Sentibubbler will release your loved ones. If you try anything to warn Ladybug or Cat Noir, I'll order the Sentibubbler to send the bubbles into space, too far for any superhero to ever save them!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Alya"|-0.148264527320862|" If I were you, I would do anything I could to ensure Ladybug showed up very shortly! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.320868015289307|"Got to gain some time!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.530184477567673|" Phew, Alya's still free! She'll be able to save us."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.515051603317261|"You see? You were right to give her the Miraculous!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.396910190582275|" Thanks, Tikki. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.033214807510376|"Ladybug! Please come save us! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.188964664936066|"What's she doing?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.033214807510376|"Ladybug! Please come save us!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.435897707939148|" Ugh, I'm just gonna have to transform in front of everyone and later use the Miraculous of the Rabbit to go back in time! Ah, no! Time travel is never a good idea! But if I don't transform, I won't have access to any of the Miraculous. Oh! Except mine!You could take it to another holder!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.763593971729279|" The earrings can't go through the bubble, Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0530918836593628|" Then, Cat Noir is our last hope. "
"Cat Noir"|"Alya"|-0.664134532213211|" No villain in sight. Watch out, m'lady. I get the feeling someone's trying to play cat and ladybug with us. I'm waiting for you! "
"Alya"|"Alya"|-0.599531650543213|"Yoo-hoo! Ladybug!Get ready, Trixx. We have to figure out a way to free Marinette, or else we're all serious goners! "
"Alya"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.307888448238373|" Hey, Sentibubbler? I have to go to the bathroom."
"Shadow Moth"|"Sentibubbler"|-0.63815900683403|"Not now!"
"Sentibubbler"|"Alya"|-0.63815900683403|"Not now!"

"Ladybug "|"Shadow Moth"|-0.649297177791595|" Shadow Moth attacked your family because he found out that you're a superhero. Unfortunately, I won't be able to give you the Miraculous of the Fox ever again. "

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.514801412820816|"Where did Shadow Moth go? "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.390452563762665|" I think he felt the wind start to change."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.26482617855072|" This could've been the end of Shadow Moth. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|-0.455840408802032|"You know, I really thought today was the end of Cat Noir. But you guys really had it under control. "

"André"|"XY"|0.742587685585022|" My good old friend Bob. How wonderful to see you. And you've brought little Xavier-Yves with you, too. "
"XY"|"André"|0.648934721946716|"Uh, my peeps call me XY, if you don't mind, Mr. Mayor. Xavier-Yves is way too-"
"André"|"Bob"|0.793490529060364|" XY! Of course! The famous DJ XY!It's an honor for the palace to receive such a fantastic artist and his father."
"Bob"|"André"|0.0238131284713745|" Does that mean dinner's on the house, then?"
"André"|"Bob"|-0.423653662204742|" Uh...uh..."
"Bob"|"André"|-0.64561203122139|"I'm joking."
"André"|"Bob"|-0.100232779979706|"You're too much, Bob. Always the comedian. Enjoy your meal. Bon appetite! "
"Bob"|"XY"|0.372775435447693|" I tried. Okay, we need to talk about this special TV appearance you're going to be making. You know, this'll be a major promotional event for you. You got any new material to premiere? New ideas?"
"XY"|"Bob"|-0.663961827754974|" 'Course not, Dad. You know I never have any ideas. "
"Bob"|"XY"|0.244972586631775|" So let me hear what you've ripped- er, what you've come up with this year.Isn't it a bit similar to what you were doing last year?"
"XY"|"Bob"|-0.658491015434265|"Oh, yeah. Guess I ripped off my own music. "
"Bob"|"XY"|0.155971646308899|" Never mind. No one will know the difference anyway. Image is key. What kind of visuals you got going? Any concepts?"
"XY"|"Bob"|-0.524036735296249|" Any what?"
"Bob"|"Bob"|0.0541051626205444|" Forget it. I'll use the same plan that's made me the rich man I am today. If you're short on great ideas, borrow someone else's. "
"Bob"|"Marinette"|0.550294280052185|" We're looking for new talent. Stunning musical and visual skills are a must. With a brand new style that everyone will die for. You have two weeks to send in your videos. "
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.753347873687744|" It's a perfect opportunity to showcase Kitty Section."
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.558890104293823|" And the stage clothes you designed, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Rose"|0.638680219650269|"If we all pitch in, two weeks is more than enough time to make an awesome video. Everyone in?"
"Rose"|"Everyone"|0.437131643295288|" Here we go!"
"Everyone"|"Rose"|-0.559089779853821|" Kitty Section!"
"Rose"|"Luka"|0.467310428619385|" You know I love unicorns"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.259410619735718|" Wow! This is so awesome! We're so in the moment. The song's fun and totally sincere.Hey, Marinette. Still no news about the contest?"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.751070007681847|" Maybe they didn't like our song?"
"Luka"|"Ivan"|0.0597331523895264|" They must've received a ton of videos. They probably haven't made their pick yet."
"Ivan"|"XY"|0.128503084182739|" Uh, oh. You better take a look at this, guys. "
"XY"|"Alec"|0.717112183570862|"...cause I love my unicorn, and fluffy blue bunnies, too! "
"Alec"|"XY"|0.581189155578613|" Wow! Lovin' the new look, XY! You've really outdone yourself this time. How did you come up with a style that's so... original?"
"XY"|"Ivan"|0.373402237892151|"It's all in here."
"Ivan"|"Luka"|0.0296299457550049|" But that's our original style!"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.249431610107422|"Your unicorn, and your mask!"
"Marinette"|"Guard 1"|-0.483339309692383|"That's your melody.It's your music. That's not fair! That should be you guys up there on TV. There better be a good explanation. We have to have it out with Bob Roth and XY."
"Guard 1"|"Marinette"|-0.426108956336975|" They're not here right now."
"Marinette"|"Guard 1"|0.509992718696594|" Seriously? They're right there on live screen."
"Guard 1"|"Marinette"|-0.679507195949554|" You're not allowed in. You don't have an invitation and the show already started."
"Marinette"|"Guard 2"|-0.343232750892639|" But it's our show!"
"Guard 2"|"Rose"|-0.642861038446426|" Not our problem, miss."
"Rose"|"Guard 2"|-0.335134565830231|" Help! Our friend's been akumatized! Ladybug and Cat Noir aren't here to save us! Quick!"
"Guard 2"|"Guard 1"|-0.764374494552612|" Stop messin' around kids, it's not gonna work."
"Guard 1"|"Alec"|0.327718377113342|" We've got work to do, so get out of here and go watch the show at home. "
"Alec"|"XY"|0.624958992004395|" Wow! Awesome, XY! Such a 180 from your last record! This might be your best yet! So tell me, where did you get the inspiration for all this new material?"
"XY"|"Luka"|-0.470758616924286|" Oh, it's nothing really. I came up with the whole song in 5 minutes."
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.719310492277145|" In 5 minutes? He couldn't even sing it the way it's supposed to be sung. "
"Marinette"|"Bob"|-0.569042176008224|" And his mask isn't even a good rip-off.Mr. Roth! My name's Marinette Dupain-Cheng. I'm the one who sent you the Kitty Section video."
"Bob"|"Marinette"|-0.254842877388|" Video? What video? I don't know what you're talking about, kid."
"Marinette"|"Bob"|0.575066328048706|" Maybe I can jog your memory? Look!The costumes, the mask, the music, the dance moves. They're all the same!"
"Bob"|"Luka"|0.241231918334961|" There's no comparison. This here is some amateur garage band. My son is a solo artist. You guys play instruments, his music is all digital. Our unicorn is much cooler, and our masks are nothing like yours."
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.704363018274307|" That's not true! You copied Marinette's costumes!"
"Marinette"|"XY"|-0.368138194084167|" And it's the exact same song. You stole Luka's music!"
"XY"|"Luka"|-0.111161112785339|" Oh, come on. Let's not exaggerate now. We may have just been a little bit... inspired, that's all. "
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.382327318191528|"Inspired?! You flat out stole! You didn't design this mask,Marinette did!"
"Marinette"|"Bob"|-0.117303609848022|" Listen, it's not too late to do the right thing. Just tell the truth and let Kitty Section appear on the show. That's all we're asking."
"Bob"|"Luka"|-0.164294064044952|" Yeah. First they'll wanna be in the show. Then they'll be asking for a cut of the profits. No way! Never saw or heard of Kitten Division."
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.612120419740677|" Forget it, Marinette. It's no big deal. Let's just go."
"Marinette"|"Bob"|-0.699706703424454|" No! It's not fair! I won't stand by and let my friends' work get stolen.If you won't tell the truth, then I will! Right now, on the air, live! "
"Bob"|"Luka"|-0.559477090835571|"If you do that, I'll tell them you're the copycats, not me. I've got all the music biz eating out of my hand. So who do you think they're gonna believe? Me, or a group of nobodies?"
"Luka"|"Bob"|-0.79955105483532|" Grrr..."
"Bob"|"Luka"|-0.743499904870987|" You'll never have a future in this business. You'll never make another costume. And there'll be no more music for your buddies because as far as everyone's concerned, you'll be the rip-off artists."
"Luka"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.79955105483532|" Grrr... "
"Hawk Moth"|"Bob"|-0.45406711101532|" Ah. I'm detecting the echo of a very rare emotion. The anger of a creator whose work has been stolen. Who also cannot bear to see the one he loves suffer.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize this pure soul."
"Bob"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.60953214764595|"Not quite so cocky now, are we? "
"Hawk Moth"|"Luka"|-0.0651665925979614|"Silencer, I am Hawk Moth. This man is the voice of evil. I'm giving you the power to silence him for good. All I ask of you in return are Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous. Do we have an agreement, Silencer?"
"Luka"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Hawk Moth"|"XY"|-0.554090470075607|"I'll take your silence as a yes. "
"XY"|"Silencer"|-0.20666116476059|"Do you have any idea how much work it took me to copy your costumes?"
"Silencer"|"Bob"|-0.665076166391373|"Shh. "
"Bob"|"Silencer"|-0.283884286880493|"What's that? "
"Silencer"|"Marinette"|-0.336017489433289|"Don't worry, Marinette. I would never hurt you. I will use the power Hawk Moth has given me to restore justice. I will force Bob Roth to admit what he has done to you and Kitty Section."
"Marinette"|"Silencer"|-0.62105792760849|" Don't do that, Luka. That's revenge, not justice. And if you team up with Hawk Moth, you'll have to face Cat Noir and Ladybug."
"Silencer"|"Marinette"|0.693853139877319|" Cat Noir and Ladybug? Where were they when we needed them? As now, Silencer is laying down the law of silence.You’re the most extraordinary girl, Marinette. Clear as a musical note and as sincere as a melody. You’re the music that’s been playing inside my head since the day we first met. I won’t let anything happen to you. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.574291080236435|" Wha!? "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.492468357086182|" Did that sound like a declaration of love to you?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.256089806556702|" I think so. Which is kind of weird coming from a villain."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.123613119125366|" Perhaps Luka feels the same way."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.466527462005615|"Do you think!? Uh, stay focused, Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Silencer"|-0.499254763126373|" Tikki, spots on! Ah!"
"Silencer"|"Bob"|-0.138073980808258|" You can't get away from me, Bob Roth. I will make you tell the truth, live on TV."
"Bob"|"Silencer"|-0.660089612007141|" Don't touch me! I'm warning you! I'm well-connected. One call to Mr. Bourgeois......and he'll bring the police for me. The whole army if he has to!"
"Silencer"|"Ladybug"|-0.665076166391373|" Shh. "
"Ladybug"|"Bob"|-0.667619913816452|" I can't let you do this, Silencer. "
"Bob"|"Ladybug"|-0.170791506767273|" And about time, too!What are you waiting for?Get to work!"
"Ladybug"|"Bob"|-0.71151214838028|"Listen, Lukaer, Silencer. You don't know what you're doing. Hawk Moth is evil. You think you're using your power for good but you're wrong. "
"Bob"|"Silencer"|-0.681011319160461|" Oh, come on! Stop mincing around and protect me!Sorry, Ladybug. Occupational hazard, I guess. No hard feelings? Bye! "
"Silencer"|"Ladybug"|-0.703231066465378|"You shouldn't have stood in my way, Ladybug."
"Ladybug"|"Silencer"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Silencer"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.182349383831024|"No Lucky Charm this time, Ladybug.You'd need your voice for that, and I'm the one who's got it.You can run, Ladybug, but you can't get away from me for long."
"Hawk Moth"|"Silencer"|-0.610756129026413|"Don't let her escape you, Silencer. She's vulnerable."
"Silencer"|"Ladybug"|-0.222349762916565|"Don't worry, Hawk Moth. Now that I've got Ladybug's voice, I have a plan to get ahold of her and Cat Noir's Miraculous.But first: revenge! "
"Ladybug"|"Plagg"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.497196435928345|" Adrien, come see this."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.372695207595825|" What is it?Ladybug?"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.7439084649086|" Looks like we got a problem."
"Adrien"|"Cat Noir"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Cat Noir"|"Silencer"|0.0702183246612549|"Meow! M'lady sent me some messages. I bet she misses me! "
"Silencer"|"Cat Noir"|0.424249649047852|"Where are you hiding, Bob Roth? You're definitely good at hiding.But you won't get away from me. I've got plans for you, too. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.464659333229065|" I'm right here, M'lady. Uh, I'm here now, so go ahead and fill me in.Of course, I should've thought of that.Hey, that's not very nice!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Cat Noir"|"Bob"|-0.666453540325165|" You're right! Let's go! We'll get your voice back and talk ourselves out of this mess!I don't want to be catty but I really don't know what you mean.We've got a major problem. I can't call out my Lucky Charm or say Miraculous Ladybug. Ah, you've definitely got a point there. The magic ladybugs won't be able to fix up all the damage caused by Silencer.And you can't say the detransformation words? Which means you'll be a mute Ladybug for the rest of your life?But it has its advantages in a way. Now you'll never be able to pick on my jokes.I'm kidding, M'lady. Don't worry, you always get us out of the worst fixes.Meanwhile, I'll be able to babble to my heart's content. "
"Bob"|"André"|-0.314240038394928|" Get away from me, you filthy critters.André? André, it's me! I need you to send in the troops."
"André"|"Bob"|0.428166270256042|"No problem, Bob. I'll take care of it. Where are you?"
"Bob"|"André"|-0.691667556762695|" The one place in Paris you've probably never step foot in. The sewers!"
"André"|"Silencer"|-0.627980381250381|" Don't worry, I'll send the police in right away! "
"Silencer"|"Cat Noir"|0.609193325042725|"Mayor Bourgeois here. Get me Officer Roger."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.468817472457886|" Maybe I could imitate your voice? Lucky Charm, Lucky Charm, Lucky Charm, Lucky Charm!Uh... yeah, okay, I'll shut up now."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.442887425422668|" Uh... cat got your tongue?A night at the opera?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Cat Noir"|"Bob"|-0.215330362319946|" You want to make Silencer say the words Lucky Charm with the voice he stole from you? Very smart! Now let's hear how you're gonna do that.Don't even think about it, M'lady. It'll never work.You're right, though, we don't have much of a choice."
"Bob"|"Roger"|0.575168609619141|" Thank you, Officer Roger. Thanks for looking out for your fellow citizens."
"Roger"|"Bob"|-0.456412136554718|"Mr. Roth, you're under arrest. "
"Bob"|"Bob"|-0.740323811769485|" What? This is a big misunderstanding!"
"Bob"|"Roger"|0.247347116470337|" Where are you taking me?"
"Roger"|"Bob"|0.316260576248169|" Mayor's orders."
"Bob"|"Roger"|0.693854928016663|" Mr. Bourgeois and I have been friends for a very long time and-"
"Roger"|"Silencer"|0.536083221435547|"Yes, we're nearly there, Mr. Mayor. "
"Silencer"|"Roger"|0.689600110054016|"Thank you, officer."
"Roger"|"Silencer"|0.177139043807983|" Uh, and who are you?"
"Silencer"|"Bob"|-0.665076166391373|" Shh. "
"Bob"|"Silencer"|-0.600078523159027|" Uh, no! Let me go!"
"Silencer"|"Bob"|-0.362061858177185|"I can take your voice, Bob Roth, and make you say whatever I please. But that's not what I want. I want you to admit what you did to Marinette and her friends with your own voice."
"Bob"|"Silencer"|-0.718696087598801|" Never! I'd rather be silent!"
"Silencer"|"Bob"|-0.69038724899292|"You really think I can't make you? Listen, I can ruin your reputation just like you threatened to do with Marinette.Everyone in showbiz knows me. I'll make sure you lose every single one of your friends.I'll put you in prison.I'll never sing for you, Dad. You'll never make another dime from my music.We'll make your life a nightmare, Bob Roth."
"Bob"|"Silencer"|-0.185972988605499|" Wait, stop! Okay, I'll do it! I'll tell the truth!"
"Silencer"|"Cat Noir"|0.604050755500793|"Dear viewers, we're back on the air for a exclusive interview with Bob Roth. He has something very important..."
"Cat Noir"|"Silencer"|-0.467678189277649|" Wait, M'lady! It might be too early to pull off your crazy plan. We could wait for Bob Roth to actually tell the truth. Then justice would be served for Kitty Section, wouldn't it?It would be revenge, not justice. And being coerced into telling the truth is meaningless. You're right, M'lady. You're not much fun but you do have a point. We have to save him.C'mon!We got all the time in the world! We might as well have a bit of fun!"
"Silencer"|"Cat Noir"|-0.624682813882828|" Keep your nose out of other people's business, kitty, or I'll silence you."
"Cat Noir"|"Silencer"|-0.649362564086914|" That would be a shame considering how hilarious I am."
"Silencer"|"Bob"|-0.564496457576752|" Where'd he go? "
"Bob"|"Cat Noir"|-0.754226475954056|" You're gonna have to do better than that, Ladybug, if you're gonna defeat this supervillain. Isn't that you and Cat Noir's job? This is all that band's faultthose Kitty what-ya-ma-callits. None of this would've happened if they hadn't made a fuss about their so-called ideas."
"Cat Noir"|"Silencer"|-0.66504442691803|" Oh, no! I can't find Ladybug anywhere! How will I ever get out of this mess without her?"
"Silencer"|"Cat Noir"|-0.00525087118148804|"Cat Noir! I'm over here!"
"Cat Noir"|"Silencer"|-0.0171342492103577|" M'lady! If you've gotten your voice back, then you've defeated Silencer! It's safe to come and find you!"
"Silencer"|"Cat Noir"|0.080601692199707|" Yes, yes, there's no danger now. Meet me outside the studio. I'll wait for you."
"Cat Noir"|"Bob"|0.613309383392334|" Okay, I'm coming! I'll meet you outside the studio door!"
"Bob"|"Cat Noir"|-0.419499218463898|" You've got to be the dumbest superheroes ever! How could you let the bad guy in on your plan? And what's with this fake Lucky Charm? I thought it was supposed to be magic or something, but it's actually just some crafty special effects."
"Cat Noir"|"Silencer"|-0.659386575222015|" You took your time. Did something hold you up?Ha, ha! You thought you had us, didn’t you, Silencer? But you’re wrong! Ladybug still has her superpowers. "
"Silencer"|"Cat Noir"|-0.233849465847015|"That’s impossible! I took your voice from you! How could you possibly have summoned up your Lucky Charm? "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.22947746515274|" I don’t see how this is going to work any better than a lamp but at least you’ve got yourself a real Lucky Charm.I’m warning you, buddy! You haven’t heard the last from Ladybug!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|0.403348445892334|" Catch this, M'lady! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.726003736257553|" Cataclysm! "
"Ladybug"|"Roger"|-0.0847017168998718|" No more evil doing for you, little akuma! Time to de-evilize!Gotcha! Bye, bye, little butterfly!You're right, this does have its advantages. Miraculous Ladybug!"
"Roger"|"Cat Noir"|0.150630116462708|"Give us back our voices!"
"Cat Noir"|"Luka"|0.583878517150879|" Ah, much better."
"Luka"|"Ladybug"|-0.688606411218643|" What happened?"
"Ladybug"|"Bob"|-0.654528379440308|" You were akumatized. But everything's fine now."
"Bob"|"Ladybug"|-0.682134628295898|"This is outrageous, Ladybug! You tied me up and imprisoned me in a dressing room!"
"Ladybug"|"Bob"|-0.666216880083084|" Me? I did that? That doesn't sound like me at all."
"Bob"|"Ladybug"|-0.577049970626831|"The ladybug and cat got you. Serves you right! What did you think, kid? That I was going to tell everybody the truth? That I stole Kitty Section's song and your girlfriend's costumes, so I could give them to my talentless son, huh?You didn't think that superheroes would come to save me, huh? That's right! They work for me now!...What's up with you guys? Why are you all smiling like that?!"
"Ladybug"|"Parisians"|0.289619445800781|" We're smiling because you're on the air, Mr. Roth.Everything you just said was broadcast live."
"Parisians"|"Bob"|-0.778291389346123|" Boooo! "
"Bob"|"Cat Noir"|0.160841941833496|" Eh heh heh heh heh. Precisely! It was all just a big joke! I actually happen to love the band Kitten Division! In fact, I love them so much that I was about to sign them to their first record deal!And now, they're going to finish off this show with their very own song! I didn't mention it earlier, to keep it a surprise! But it was my idea from the start!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.458213031291962|" We usually save the good guys from the baddies, but I've got my doubts about this one. You sure he hasn't been akumatized? "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.613191455602646|" Nope. He's like that all the time.Gotta go! I'm about to transform back. See you soon, my kitty."
"Cat Noir"|"Parisians"|0.716528415679932|"I love when she calls me that."
"Parisians"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Hawk Moth"|"Alec"|-0.579347491264343|" You broke the laws of silence, Ladybug. But I'm preparing an act of vengeance for you that will leave you speechless! "
"Alec"|"Marinette"|0.746029734611511|" And now, please welcome the next big thing in town: Kitty Section!"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.453278243541718|"Luka? Did you really mean those things you said when you were akumatized?"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.678891658782959|" I'm sorry, Marinette, but I don't remember. What did I say?"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.651622653007507|" Uh, oh, nothing. It was nothing at all. You were possessed by Hawk Moth's akuma."
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.478679537773132|" I don't know what I possibly could've said. I just hope it wasn't anything mean. Because you're the most extraordinary girl, Marinette. As clear as a musical note and as sincere as a melody. You’re the music that’s been playing inside my head since the first day we met. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.45444643497467|" That was a declaration of love. Right, Tikki?"
"Tikki"|"André"|0.80736517906189|" One of the most beautiful ones I've ever heard!"
"Alec"|"Alec"|0.502704620361328|" Welcome back to everyone's #1 live game show: The Challenge! Let's give it up for our awesome contestant, Nino!"
"Alec"|"Marinette"|0.704445719718933|" So Nino, you're a student and a DJ. That's pretty awesome! Check out the decks we got for you!"
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.616696029901505|" Grounded? For what?!"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.524006575345993|" Let's jog your memory, Marinette. Monday morning, absent from P.E..."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.288325190544128|" I was in study hall."
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.74177548289299|" Friday evening, absent from study hall."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.535719126462936|" I was at P.E.!"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.622672110795975|" You're never where you're supposed to be, Marinette! The only way we can keep track of you is by keeping you here, grounded."
"Marinette"|"Alec"|-0.246739387512207|" But I was invited... Nino is my friend, he was counting on me."
"Alec"|"André"|0.581096529960632|" So, the challenge the viewers have chosen for you is... To get the mayor of Paris, André Bourgeois, to dance! Thank you for agreeing to play with us today, sir. What are Nino's chances tonight?"
"André"|"Tom"|-0.698494762182236|"Zero. I despise dancing. The last time I set foot on a dance floor, Madonna was in kindergarten."
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.461789548397064|" I know Nino's your friend. But until your unexcused absences come to an end, that's the way it's going to be."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.759617209434509|" Awesome. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.785416230559349|" Can you blame them? How are they supposed to know that you're missing class to save the world?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.430063605308533|"I guess being grounded comes with the territory of being a top secret superhero. Doesn't seem fair though."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.19126832485199|" It's not. But hey, if Nino wins, you're not grounded next week. You can go see him at the show!"
"Marinette"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.278792262077332|" Yeah, but Adrien was there today! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Marinette"|-0.609440743923187|"The Challenge... what an interesting concept. A TV show with such potential with negative emotions. Oh, the destructive mayhem we could cause..."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.266410231590271|" Seriously? How can you say that, Alya?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.778538018465042|" Sorry, but I kinda get your dad, Marinette. You're never where you say you'll be. Showing up late, splitting mysteriously and all. I'd almost suspect you were leading...a double life."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.766083672642708|"Gimme a break! You're being ridiculous."
"Adrien"|"Alec"|-0.476778209209442|"No! It's okay!"
"Alec"|"André Bourgeois"|-0.0235167741775513|" Victory! Challenge conquered by Nino. You moved your head to the beat, Mayor Bourgeois! That counts as dancing!"
"André Bourgeois"|"Alec"|-0.705104053020477|"What?! That's not true! My neck was... itching, that's all."
"Alec"|"Adrien"|0.187607884407043|" Relieving an itch to the beat counts as dancing, too! Nino, congratulations. You'll return in one week to meet your next challenge! And now, for our next contestant, welcome Simon Grimault!"
"Adrien"|"Alec"|0.646104216575623|"Awesome, dude!"
"Alec"|"Simon"|-0.155144095420837|" Mr. Grimault, you are a hypnotist. You use cards to hypnotize people to get what you want from them!"
"Simon"|"Alec"|-0.540138900279999|" Well, yes, I'm a hypnotist. But, uh, I don't use my skills to get anything."
"Alec"|"Gabriel"|0.59640109539032|" So, your challenge today, Simon, is to use your talents to bring a very elusive celebrity to this very TV set! Give it up for the king of fashion, Gabriel Agreste!"
"Gabriel"|"Nino"|0.460779786109924|" What is this show? I was told this was an interview."
"Nino"|"Alec"|-0.511425912380219|" Dude, your dad!"
"Alec"|"Simon"|0.660480618476868|" Do your thing, Grimault, let's see if you can bring Mr. Agreste here with your hypnotic persuasion!"
"Simon"|"Alec"|-0.645886659622192|" I told you, I don't make people"
"Alec"|"Gabriel"|-0.402169704437256|" Ha! A shy hypnotist! How funny is that, Gabriel?"
"Gabriel"|"Alec"|-0.768434971570969|" Hilarious. Your show is pathetic. And so is your contestant. Control me? Never. "
"Alec"|"Adrien"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?"
"Adrien"|"Alec"|0.529189825057983|" That's my dad, all right."
"Alec"|"Simon"|-0.504745900630951|" Looks like Mr. Agreste has turned on your challenge. Game over!"
"Simon"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.712428629398346|" But... that's not fair! I didn't even get time to... "
"Hawk Moth"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.493313491344452|" Yes. Humiliation and anger. The perfect elements for transforming a loser into a winner.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize him!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Simon"|0.622603416442871|" I am Hawk Moth. You are now Simon Says. I will help you be the most powerful hypnotist ever. You will help me in return when the time's right. So, do we have a deal, Simon Says?"
"Simon"|"Simon Says"|0.48561692237854|" Simon says yes. "
"Simon Says"|"Alec"|-0.542863816022873|" Simon says the show is not over!"
"Alec"|"Simon Says"|-0.642002046108246|" What on earth?!"
"Simon Says"|"Simon Says"|-0.752631917595863|"Silence! Silence saysyou're lame! As lame as a duck!"
"Simon Says"|"Tikki"|-0.249673008918762|" Simon says stop!Simon says you are a Gorilla! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.00117909908294678|" Marinette, look!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.289355516433716|"Ah! I gotta go, Alya!"

"Gabriel"|"Ladybug"|0.0933951139450073|" Head up to your room now. You've had enough excitement for today. Nathalie, make sure they stay there. I have to apologize for my son, Ladybug. He's like his mother. Way too overly dramatic."

"Cat Noir"|"Gabriel"|-0.657564073801041|" You're in danger, like everyone else!So stop pretending you're above us all, just do what I tell you to!"
"Gabriel"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.581587433815002|" Quite a temper. You remind me of someone."
"Hawk Moth"|"Simon Says"|-0.70309054851532|" I don't think that's a good idea, Simon Says."
"Simon Says"|"Hawk Moth"|0.625766754150391|" Gabriel is here!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Simon Says"|0.434699535369873|" Yes, but don't forget our deal. I feel Ladybug and Cat Noir nearby. Once you've got them in front of you, you'll be able to honor our agreement. Just take their jewels, the Miraculouses."
"Simon Says"|"Nino"|0.700446009635925|" It's as good as done. Simon says we'll defeat them!"

"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.708943068981171|"There's no one here on the set to repair it. And since I know how talented you are with sewing, I was hoping you could come and give me a hand."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.026652991771698|" In marriage? I'd love to! I didn't mean that first part or the second part. I mean, I'd love to help you, not marry you. Heh-heh!Operation Adrien's Rescue is a go. I'm jumping directly from level 2, \"talking to him\", to level 48, \"doing Adrien a favor\"! And once I've helped him out, since he's so nice, polite, and grateful... He'll ask me:"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.642942428588867|"How can I ever thank you, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.635730147361755|" Well, Adrien, I've love it if you'd go to the movies with me to see \"The Umbrellas of Deauville\"!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.69625997543335|"How amazing, Marinette! That's my favorite film!"
"Marinette"|"Manon"|0.613820791244507|" So, then, we'll go to the 3:17PM screening, because there's an 89.5% chance we'll pass André, the ice cream man, on the way. We'll share a sweet hearts ice cream cone, which will make us miss the beginning of the movie, and "
"Manon"|"Marinette"|0.0316625833511353|"Wouldn't it be more simple to just give him your drawing?"
"Marinette"|"Manon"|-0.46715122461319|" Huh! No, no! Telling a boy you like him is way more complicated than a drawing."
"Manon"|"Marinette"|0.609478831291199|" It's gonna be so cool to see you do it!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.57335901260376|" W-Wait a second. Sorry!You're not gonna see anything. You're gonna be good, and stay..."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.578302204608917|" ...Ha-ha, not here at all! You guys are gonna go...Oh..."
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.525817036628723|" We're off to the Chocolate Convention. See you tonight, sweetheart."
"Marinette"|"Gina"|-0.168679296970367|" Oh..."
"Gina"|"Marinette"|0.786181449890137|" I'm learning kung fu in China, sweetie. Remember? Oh! And I met a little girl who reminds me so much of you."
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.598286598920822|" Nope..."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.370143175125122|" Why would I want to go out? I like it just fine here at home!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.683257102966309|"That's perfect!"
"Rolland"|"Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris"|-0.285990715026855|" No, no, no, and no again! Babysitting is too complicated! I got Brioche loaves to bake and-"
"Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris"|"Manon"|0.645156860351562|" YAY! "
"Manon"|"Marinette"|0.193909645080566|" Wow!Wow! What's this frisbee made of?"
"Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.69545567035675|" No, it's fragile!"
"Chris"|"Marinette"|0.42690634727478|" Yeah, yeah, yeah!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.388501346111298|" Chris, no! STOP! Give me that!"
"Rolland"|"Ella and Etta"|0.551198124885559|" First, a game of darts, then I'll show you kids how to make a potato cannon!"
"Ella and Etta"|"Marinette"|0.261122941970825|" YEAH!"
"Marinette"|"Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris"|0.0429688692092896|" NO!Forget the potato cannon and the darts. Too dangerous. Just keep it simple, Grandpa! Let them watch a cartoon!"
"Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris"|"Rolland"|0.261122941970825|" YEAH!"
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.110426843166351|" You call that \"simple\"? What are all these buttons anyway, and where do you put the video cassette?!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.271207928657532|" This is a laptop computer, and this is the keyboard. You don't need a cassette. The film is already on the hard drive."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|0.18644392490387|" Now you want me to drive somewhere to get the film? But that's not how it's done!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.177282392978668|" Don't worry, Grandpa. You don't have to drive anywhere! The kids know how to use it."
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.037846565246582|" I'll be back as soon as I can. Thank you, Grandpa! Be quiet, kids! Goodbye! "
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.560151398181915|" Hmm..."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.368311882019043|" And now, let's go save Adrien! "
"Cat Noir"|"Rolland"|-0.726003736257553|" Cataclysm!"
"Rolland"|"Etta"|-0.481356859207153|" Hang on. I don't get it. The villain is that cat girl?"
"Etta"|"Chris"|-0.520672678947449|"Of course not! He's a boy!"
"Chris"|"Rolland"|0.460420489311218|" And, and Cat Noir's a good guy!"
"Rolland"|"Manon"|-0.70855587720871|" Since when do good guys break everything?"
"Manon"|"Rolland"|-0.392722547054291|" He's not breaking stuff! He's doing the Cataclysm thing to help Ladybug win!"
"Rolland"|"Ella"|-0.639420479536057|" Oh, okay. So, this Mime guy, he's the bad guy?"
"Ella"|"Rolland"|-0.380265653133392|" No! Hawk Moth is the bad guy. He waits until the Mime gets really mad so he can akumatize him. And then he makes him think Ladybug and Cat Noir are the bad guys!"
"Rolland"|"Manon"|-0.402038812637329|" Argh! In my day, telling good guys from bad guys was much simpler! They would just fight each other and whoever was the strongest one wins!"
"Manon"|"Rolland"|-0.560620069503784|" Oh, but Ladybug never hits anybody, 'cause she has her Lucky Charm!"
"Rolland"|"Chris"|-0.375934660434723|" Oh, what was this thingalucky now? "
"Chris"|"Etta"|0.283312439918518|" It's a thing she uses with other stuff to catch the akuma!"
"Etta"|"Rolland"|0.319661021232605|" And then she wins!"
"Rolland"|"Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris"|-0.19999361038208|" Stop, stop. This is way too complicated! Let's just watch my VHS copy of the '98 World Cup finals. At least that's something simple!"
"Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris"|"Marinette"|-0.641457498073578|" NOOOOOOOOOO!!!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.767621636390686|" Perfect!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.597235202789307|" I'm so glad I thought to call you, Marinette. How can I ever thank you?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.21576464176178|" How would you like to be 89.5% late for a movie?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.560151398181915|" Hmm?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.121439874172211|" I meant to sing under the umbrellas of ice cream! AAAH! I'm so pleased that you're thanking me, and now I can't thank you enough for thanking me. Uh, no! What I meant to say was-"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.467351317405701|" Marinette, you don't need to thank me. I'm the one thanking you! I have to go now. See you later! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.616099029779434|" Uh, well, uh, thanks for saying thanks.UGGH! I messed it all up, as usual!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.670727550983429|" Don't you think you made it harder than it needed to be?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.438218057155609|" You're right, Tikki. I need a second chance."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.00316095352172852|" I know!I'll just have to break the wing again! I'll set up a fishing rod and drop a hook to rip it! That way, Adrien will have to call me, so I'll come repair his wing again, and he'll say thank you again, and-"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.564796894788742|"But that's even more complicated!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|0.21718692779541|" Love is always complicated, Tikki."
"Rolland"|"Marinette"|-0.719889849424362|" MARINETTE, I'M COMPLETELY LOST!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.253621935844421|" That's great news, Grandpa, but I can't talk right now. I have to borrow a fishing rod! Have fun! I'll be back soon!"
"Marinette"|"Unnamed person with a fishing rod"|0.753515958786011|" Hey! Nice fishing rod!"
"Unnamed person with a fishing rod"|"Rolland"|-0.53922113776207|" Uh... You think?"
"Rolland"|"Rolland"|-0.623125314712524|" MARINETTE!?!"
"Rolland"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.750882685184479|" What is wrong with the world these days?! Why has everything become so complicated?! Waaaah!!!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.426705837249756|" Ah! The overwhelming confusion of a grandfather faced with the complexities of our modern world. How difficult it is to adapt, especially when one is trapped in the past!Fly away, my little Akuma, and help him simplify this all-too-complicated world!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Rolland"|-0.373028457164764|"Unravelder, I am Shadow Moth."
"Rolland"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.106108725070953|" Unravelder? What kind of complicated name is that?"
"Shadow Moth"|"Rolland"|-0.723545461893082|"Well, uh... Doctor Obsolete?"
"Rolland"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.657054275274277|" I'm not a Doctor!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Rolland"|0.495286703109741|"How about Simpleman? Will that do?"
"Rolland"|"Shadow Moth"|0.35091233253479|" There! Now that's simple!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Rolland"|-0.6034115254879|" Well, then, Simpleman, Ladybug and Cat Noir are also complicating my life. That's why I'm giving you the power to simplify everything."
"Rolland"|"Manon"|-0.333130836486816|" Ah! Now that I understand!"
"Manon"|"Chris"|-0.589020162820816|" Oh, no! Grandpa Rolland!"
"Chris"|"Simpleman"|-0.107463181018829|" You got akumatized because of us?"
"Simpleman"|"Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris"|-0.663470804691315|" Don't worry, kids. You're not a problem at all. The problem is the world around you! I'm going to show you how much better life can be with everything is simpler!Oh! Argh!"
"Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.560151398181915|" Hmm..."
"Shadow Moth"|"Simpleman"|0.741817116737366|"And don't forget the simplest mission of all. Bring me back Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous."
"Simpleman"|"Shadow Moth"|0.187699675559998|" Piece of cake! One blow from this baker's peel, and EVERYONE WILL BE HIT, SUPERHERO OR NOT!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Simpleman"|-0.569764524698257|" No! Wait!"
"Simpleman"|"Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris"|-0.512600928544998|" SIMPLIFICATION!!!"
"Manon, Ella, Etta and Chris"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.710821598768234|" Oh, no!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Simpleman"|-0.713922709226608|" Argh! Foolish villain! You hit me! I'm taking back your power!"
"Simpleman"|"Shadow Moth"|0.31684684753418|" Make up your mind already, do you want your Miraculous or not?"
"Shadow Moth"|"Simpleman"|0.582907795906067|" Hmm... Yes. Go ahead."
"Simpleman"|"Civilian 1"|-0.0267004370689392|" You see how simple life can be when nothing is complicated?"
"Civilian 1"|"Civilian 1"|-0.413255751132965|" Hm."
"Civilian 1"|"Civilian 2"|-0.664513766765594|" Why didn't you stop instead of driving right into me?"
"Civilian 2"|"Civilian 1"|-0.687517523765564|" Turning's too complicated! All you had to do was back up!"
"Civilian 1"|"Roger"|-0.360318422317505|" Backing up is even more complicated! I'd rather just go straight, it's simpler!"
"Roger"|"Nadja"|-0.657983899116516|"Since you're not letting me through, I'm prohibiting all cars! It'll be simpler this way. Car prohibited! Prohibited! Prohibited! And prohibited again!"
"Nadja"|"Clara"|-0.296363115310669|" I, Nadja, the reporter inside the TV, tell you all about the things happening around us. And today, things are going pretty badly, right, Clara?"
"Clara"|"Cameraman"|-0.470007240772247|" Yes, I'm Clara, and I'm a reporter in a helicopter! There are many problems in Paris! People are not happy at all, because their cars are immobilised!"
"Cameraman"|"Clara"|-0.735259830951691|" I can't see anything, the helicopter is going to fast!"
"Clara"|"Pilot"|-0.727858752012253|" Stop, pilot. We can't see the cars anymore!"
"Pilot"|"Vincent"|-0.620050936937332|" Uh... stop? Ah, there! There."
"Vincent"|"Marinette"|0.248427033424377|" Mah, this photo session is too complicated, we just got to take photos of Adrien smiling, it would be more simple."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.277072310447693|" Why am I complicating my life with this fishing rod? I'm just gonna tell Adrien that I love him."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.526618182659149|" Adrien! Adrien!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.504816472530365|" Oh, a falling helicopter! What should I do? Oh, I know! I have to transform!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.55987012386322|" Careful, Marinette, it's a secret. You should hide first."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.57906973361969|" Oh, right! But where can I hide?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.351725816726685|" In the elevator, behind a metal pillar? It's a very hard choice."
"Marinette"|"Clara, Cameraman, and pilot"|-0.714518547058105|" Woah! Oh no, it took me way to long to think and now the helicopter's crashed!"
"Clara, Cameraman, and pilot"|"Marinette"|-0.509288340806961|" Help! Ladybug, Cat Noir, save us!"
"Marinette"|"Vincent"|0.0700151920318604|" Come on, Tikki. Spots on!"
"Vincent"|"Adrien"|0.400107264518738|" Okay guys, that's enough for today. I got all I need."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.450426757335663|" I'm supposed to smile, but I'm supposed to save people. This is a complicated choice."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.110950469970703|" The simplest thing to do is to would be to stay here and eat cheese!"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.2583287358284|" No, Plagg! The simplest thing is to do as Ladybug does. She's always right, and I love her. So I'll just do what she does!"
"Adrien"|"Pilot"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Pilot"|"Cameraman"|0.554375052452087|" Thank you, Cat Noir!"

"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.667409986257553|" SHADOW MOTH!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.474589169025421|" An akumatized villain is going to want to fight us so they can steal our Miraculous!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.475892305374146|" Oh, boy, it's gonna be really complicated."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.267632603645325|" Wouldn't it be simpler to fight Shadow Moth directly?"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|0.494012594223022|" Oh, of course!"
"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|"Recycling Man"|0.622238278388977|" Let's go!"
"Recycling Man"|"Ella"|-0.366076111793518|" Everything into the trash, much simpler."
"Ella"|"Etta"|0.633511066436768|" Simpleman! I want a Chocolate Pistachio cone!"
"Etta"|"André"|0.63943612575531|" And I want caramel hazelnut and cherry!"
"André"|"Simpleman"|-0.538556456565857|" Oh, sorry, children, it's just vanilla now. Having only one flavor is much more simple!"
"Simpleman"|"Ella"|0.523032665252686|" Now that's much better."
"Ella"|"Simpleman"|-0.0608752369880676|" I liked it better when everything was less simple."
"Simpleman"|"Pizza Delivery guy"|-0.248893082141876|" Hey! What's going on?"
"Pizza Delivery guy"|"Simpleman"|0.53564977645874|" Veggie pizza for everyone! Only one choice of topping, it's much simpler!"
"Simpleman"|"Manon"|-0.549447804689407|" Meh, that's true!"
"Manon"|"Chris"|-0.761496141552925|" Seems kinda dangerous when things are simple. Don't you think?"
"Chris"|"Ladybug"|-0.0610240697860718|" Ladybug and Cat Noir will be here soon. Don't worry."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.250747680664062|" HEY!! SHADOW MOTH, WE'RE HERE!"
"Cat Noir"|"Simpleman"|-0.208457469940186|" Come and fight us!"
"Simpleman"|"Shadow Moth"|0.266989827156067|" You see that kids? Simplified heroes means easily found Miraculous. Come on! Let's simply pick them up!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Ladybug"|0.0782051086425781|"Ha-ha! And I will stay hidden! That way I will win easily!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.102312684059143|" Hey, Shadow Moth!!"

"Manon"|"Ladybug"|-0.286142766475677|" It'll be okay, Chris. Superheroes always win!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0460705757141113|" Fighting is much more simple!"

"Parisian 3"|"Officer Rogers"|-0.0383095741271973|" What for?"
"Officer Rogers"|"Manon"|-0.775515034794807|" Hm... uh, me upset. Jail."
"Manon"|"Ladybug"|-0.107271254062653|" Quick Ladybug! Use your Lucky Charm to fight the villain!"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.658301115036011|" Lucky Charm?"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.534781575202942|" Wow! Cool! Hey Simpleman, take this!"

"Shadow Moth"|"Simpleman"|0.717587351799011|"Candy! Simpleman! Candy for Miraculous! Everyone loves candy!"
"Simpleman"|"Simpleman"|0.570046663284302|" Now that's a plan simple, efficient and easy to understand!"
"Simpleman"|"Ladybug"|0.421604037284851|" Ladybug, Cat Noir? Let's stop fighting and make peace. Give me your miraculous and in exchange I'll give you some candy."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.66408097743988|" Candy, I love candy!"
"Cat Noir"|"Manon"|0.479502558708191|" Everyone loves candy!"
"Manon"|"Chris"|-0.461212158203125|" No! Never take candy from a stranger!"

"Ella, Etta, Manon, Chris"|"Chris"|-0.628351271152496|" NOOO!"
"Chris"|"Ella"|-0.458653807640076|" You have to win against the bad guy!"
"Ella"|"Ladybug"|-0.726480484008789|" We don't want everyone to see weird like this."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.652935147285461|" But the bad guy is too bad!"
"Cat Noir"|"Simpleman"|0.522966861724854|" Look how strong he is!"
"Simpleman"|"Etta"|0.532760143280029|" Ha! That's true!"
"Etta"|"Ella"|0.222639203071594|" Our sister always telling us that you're the strongest!"
"Ella"|"Ladybug"|-0.0242226123809814|" And that you're smarter than the bad guys!"
"Ladybug"|"Manon"|-0.0960317850112915|" Lucky Charm is too complicated."
"Manon"|"Ladybug"|-0.505613029003143|" No, it's very simple! It's like a riddle. For example, you can take the air out of the ball and then use a pipe to attach it to the bicycle pump! And, and then you throw it under the bad guy's stick!"
"Ladybug"|"Etta"|-0.478732228279114|" Without air in it?"
"Etta"|"Ella"|-0.582656234502792|" A-and when the ball's under the stick you just have to blow it up again!"
"Ella"|"Chris"|0.27960729598999|" And when the ball grows bigger it'll make the stick bounce!"
"Chris"|"Ladybug"|-0.116652190685272|" Then Cat Noir can catch it and cataclysm it!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.724946528673172|" But I don't have a bicycle pump."
"Cat Noir"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.599773168563843|" Can I just cataclysm the bad guy?"
"Shadow Moth"|"Simpleman"|-0.730673789978027|"Hey! Explaining complicated stuff is cheating!"
"Simpleman"|"Chris"|-0.325269639492035|" You get there then. Sorry, but I'm gonna have to simplify you too kids! SIMPLIFICATION!"

"Rolland"|"Chris"|-0.286397516727448|" Oh, is that so? How could this little thing protect me from Shadow-What's-His-Name? The world used to be so simple, I used to understand it! Now I don't understand anything anymore."

"Manon"|"Rolland"|-0.685948699712753|" It's funny it's kind of like a game that you have to win each time, but you're a grown-up and you're not used to it anymore, so it scares you."
"Rolland"|"Etta"|0.705747008323669|" You think I can still learn something at my age?"
"Etta"|"Marinette"|0.650669097900391|" Sure, if you want!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.143287897109985|" What am I doing, honestly? The truth is, I'm scared that Adrien will reject me if I tell him how I feel about him. That's why I over complicate everything, so that moment never comes. But whether my plan is complicated or simple, the result will be the same. So I might as well be simple and face my fear! I'm just gonna tell him that I love him quite simply."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.0256962776184082|" Yes! Go on, Marinette! Be simple."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.388314068317413|" Adrien!"

"Marinette"|"Vincent"|-0.669215768575668|" Me neither! Well, I'm not gonna keep you any longer, okay? Now that you've got your wings back."
"Vincent"|"Marinette"|0.391091346740723|" Action!"
"Marinette"|"Rolland"|-0.507609903812408|" You know what, Tikki? Sometimes trying to be simple is just too complicated."

"Rolland"|"The kids"|0.0323232412338257|" Plus not! It's actually quite simple. Come sit with us, we'll explain everything. So, look. This little guy in black is not a bad fellow. I think you know in red, well it's simple. Even when things are complicated, she never gives up! In fact, she reminds me of your grandmother when I first met her. I know it seems crazy, but she looks exactly like her! And all our ideas are kind of the same!"
"The kids"|"Ziggy"|-0.69317352771759|" Shhh!"
"Taxi Driver"|"Zoé"|0.10572624206543|" You'll discover for yourself, Mademoiselle, but one can never see too much of Paris.Does the Eiffel Tower need an introduction? And to think that when it was first built, the Parisians thought it would stuck out like a sore thumb.And over there are the Trocadéro gardens. Did you know that underneath there is an aquarium, the first in the world built in 1867.The Louvre, the largest museum in the world. So huge that it would take a hundred days to see everything! Originally, the Louvre was a fortress built to protect our city. These days, it protects our art. Speaking of protecting the city, there are our local miracles, Ladybug and Cat Noir!"
"Zoé"|"Taxi Driver"|0.606393098831177|"Can we stop here? I've always dreamed of eating a real Parisian croissant."
"Taxi Driver"|"Sabine"|-0.157344400882721|" You couldn't have picked a better place this is the best bakery in Paris. My kids adore their croissants."

"Zoé"|"Marinette"|-0.21314525604248|" Is everyone all right?"
"Marinette"|"Zoé"|-0.729741215705872|" Sorry, sorry, sorry!"
"Zoé"|"Marinette"|-0.558978974819183|" It's totally okay, but maybe I should be asking if you're okay. That was quite a fall!"
"Marinette"|"Zoé"|-0.652668923139572|"Don't worry about me, I'll be fine, thanks. I'm pretty clumsy so I'm used to it. Come to think of it, I fall a lot. I fall on my face, fall asleep, fall out of bed, fall apart of the seams fall in love...I really am sorry about all of this, how can I make it up to you?"
"Zoé"|"Marinette"|-0.677458226680756|" It's nothing, don't worry!"
"Marinette"|"Zoé"|-0.0628435015678406|" Mom, can you put together a dozen more croissants for..."
"Zoé"|"Marinette"|-0.585322141647339|" Zoé."

"Zoé"|"Marinette"|0.411193609237671|" I'm- uh- here to be with my family."
"Marinette"|"Zoé"|0.659578204154968|" Well then it's gonna be a great trip, no matter where you are, if you're with the ones you love, then you feel right at home."
"Zoé"|"Marinette"|-0.76048643887043|" Sorry."
"Marinette"|"Zoé"|0.422252535820007|"Wow, your sneakers are awesome! Did you decorate them yourself?"
"Zoé"|"Marinette"|0.749461054801941|" Yeah, I've written every nice thing that anyone's ever said to me, to keep them with me all the time."
"Marinette"|"Zoé"|-0.574294060468674|" But there's only one message!"
"Zoé"|"Marinette"|-0.583188027143478|" I only had one friend."
"Marinette"|"Zoé"|0.0662872791290283|" Oh...If you're not doing anything with your family tonight, my friends are performing a concert on a river march. Let me give you my number! "
"Zoé"|"Marinette"|0.539459109306335|" I can give you mine too if you want. "
"Marinette"|"Zoé"|0.345090866088867|" This way I won't lose it for sure. "
"Zoé"|"Marinette"|-0.479446947574615|" Bye!"

"Zoé"|"Taxi Driver"|0.551676988601685|"There, share it with your kids."
"Taxi Driver"|"Zoé"|-0.527932584285736|" Wow, but don't you want to keep some for your family?"
"Zoé"|"Taxi Driver"|-0.514913856983185|" Nah, they prefer sour to sweets."
"Taxi Driver"|"Butler Jean"|0.603249192237854|" Well, thanks, miss. Enjoy your journey."
"Butler Jean"|"Butler Jean"|0.582852244377136|" Oh, welcome back, Mademoiselle Zoé. Please, follow me."
"Butler Jean"|"Audrey"|-0.337409973144531|" Pardon me madame, but your daughter Mademoiselle Zoé has arrived."
"Audrey"|"Zoé"|-0.73381307721138|" Zoé?Oh, you look terrible! I'm guessing the flight was horrific."
"Zoé"|"Audrey"|-0.735047698020935|" Someone in economy class- uh- smelled like disgusting cologne, and the flight attendants refused to open a window to air help the plane!"
"Audrey"|"Zoé"|-0.730195015668869|" Your father forgot to provide a private jet for you too busy for anyone, as usual. It's fine that you want to come live with us in Paris, but what exactly was wrong with your boarding school again?"
"Zoé"|"Audrey"|-0.261053800582886|" I- I found roaches in my locker, can you believe it?"
"Audrey"|"Chloé"|0.303848266601562|" Well, that's nice, dear. Jean Quinton. Take her to see her sister."
"Chloé"|"André"|0.173287391662598|" So… you're Zoé? Blonde hair, blue eyes… Good, so far you're measuring up to the family standards, you can make an acceptable sister physically, at least. Cellphone!You'll have to change the case. Not enough gold or diamonds!Ah! What are those?!See these? These shoes are light and in life, there are winners and losers. Winners have their perfect little feet in these shoes while losers get crushedunder the soles. So you want them?Uh uh uh! If you want to be a winner and be part of this family, you're gonna have to earn your place. But don't worry, I'll be your mentor and if you prove worthy enough to be my sister, well then, maybe…I'll let you borrow my shoes! Rule number one: your father only exists to give you everything you want whenever you want.DADDY!I want the limo painted pink before I go to school!"
"André"|"Chloé"|-0.306356489658356|" What? But sweetheart-"
"Chloé"|"Zoé"|0.269322156906128|"Since your father isn't here, you'll use mine! If you become my sister, of course. Rule number two: you need a minion. Where's yours?"
"Zoé"|"Chloé"|-0.646193653345108|" Uhhh, I left them…in New York!"
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.748454660177231|"Fatal mistake! You never go anywhere without your minion!Don't confuse a minion for a patsy which I'll teach you about later. A minion is someone who does everything for you.Aren't you done with that math homework yet?"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|-0.667399287223816|" Sorry, Chloé. It's taking me a little longer 'cause it's so dark in here but now that my eyes are used to having no light, it'll go much faster! "
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.140404880046844|" Now, a patsy is there to suffer for your own entertainment. If you're good enough, a patsy can last you a lifetime. I have an old one but it hasn't been working so well ever since I became a superhero. I got too soft. She's yours if you could do something with her. "
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|0.585208058357239|" Another super important rule. Number 72: All the boys have to be crazy about you carrying your school bag up the stairs should be the highlight of their day. Not you, no, not you, either or you, but you can shine my shoes in your dreams tonight! You!Here! "
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|-0.76048643887043|"Sorry! "
"Chloé"|"Zoé"|-0.447113215923309|" Hey you nobodies! Stop your meaningless chatter for a minute and listen up! This is uh...what’s your name again?"
"Zoé"|"Chloé"|-0.585322141647339|" Zoé."
"Chloé"|"Rose"|0.707169890403748|"We’ll buy you a new name later.This is Zoé. She’s only my half-sister for now but you must still treat her with respect, so bow down...uh, I mean give her the welcome her status deserves."
"Rose"|"Alya"|0.121218800544739|" Her sister? Chloé has a sister?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.680157899856567|" If we’re lucky, she’ll only be half as horrible."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.62325331568718|" Relax girls! I met her at the bakery earlier. She’s totally nothing like Chloé. She’s actually really nice! And besides we shouldn’t make snap judgments about people before we get to know them, right? "
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.599505305290222|"Hey, what's up, man."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.211349427700043|" Ah, rule number 148: obviously, you need a guy BFF to wrap around your finger. Preferably gorgeous and very rich.That one over there is mine, Adrikins! He's the best there is. So keep your hands off, you here! We'll find you a less handsome one because you're less pretty than me, obviously.Ah! Here comes the patsy I was telling you about. If you can do a number on her, then I'll make you my real sister. Watch and learn.Still loafing around, Dupain-Cheng?Hello, she's a baker's daughter, get it? "
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.75381600856781|" Hey, Zoé. What'd you think about the macaroons? Good, huh?"
"Chloé"|"Zoé"|0.271188974380493|"What?! You know Dupain-Cheng?!"
"Zoé"|"Sabrina"|-0.716726779937744|"Y-yeah, we've met.This clueless klutz knocked me down! So she gave me some super, uh… disgusting… macaroonsthinking that it would be enough to make up for it, but since I have good taste, I threw them out. "
"Sabrina"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.570864319801331|"Can I do your homework?"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Chloé"|-0.148544907569885|" Find a spot. Find a spot! Mid-year admission is not so easy. There's a lot of paperwork-"
"Chloé"|"Zoé"|-0.305572509765625|"Rule number 38."
"Zoé"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.201233625411987|"Would you like me to call my stepfather, Mayor Bourgeois, and let him know how utterly useless you've been. So useless, in fact, that this would surely run just as wellwithout you!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.759285405278206|"Uhhhh…"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Marinette"|0.702576160430908|" May I introduce your new schoolmate, Zoé. Please obey, I mean, give her a warm welcome."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.506331205368042|"I don't understand. When I met her this morning, she was so nice."
"Alya"|"Alix"|-0.57054141163826|" That's crazy. Chloe's influence is so toxic that she's managed to corrupt her sister in a few hours."
"Alix"|"Mylène"|-0.0516622066497803|" We gotta get her out of there."
"Mylène"|"Rose"|0.490672588348389|" Who will take her in?"
"Rose"|"Marinette"|0.444474697113037|" Do you think we can adopt her?"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.0824886560440063|" Let's just talk to her first. I'll handle it."
"Chloé"|"Zoé"|-0.0532746315002441|" Needs improvement, but not such a bad start. As a reward, I'll let you touch my diamond shoes when we're home. "
"Zoé"|"Sabrina"|0.612814664840698|" Thank you? "
"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|0.6573086977005|"See you later! "
"Marinette"|"Daizzi"|-0.627042055130005|" Why did she become so nasty when she was so nice before?"
"Daizzi"|"Marinette"|0.0586490631103516|" Maybe she was…hungry?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.433045387268066|" I'm sure the real Zoé is the one I met the first time. I hope I can get to the bottom of this."
"Tikki"|"Mullo"|0.682540774345398|" As long as you're acting with kindness, Marinette, you can't go wrong."
"Mullo"|"Chloé"|0.0354734659194946|" Mm-hmm."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.616688638925552|" No.No."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.271144032478333|"I can tell something is keeping you from being yourself. If it's Chloé, we can talk about it tonight, if you want. You're still welcome to come to the Barge."
"Chloé"|"Zoé"|-0.725869178771973|"Ridiculous! "
"Zoé"|"Chloé"|-0.601402044296265|"Sorry. I'll explain tonight. "
"Chloé"|"Zoé"|-0.0753167867660522|"Are you texting Dupain-Cheng?! I warned you! You walk over people, or I walk over you! Either you're proud to be who you are, proud to be a part of my family and you walk in my footsteps, or you clear out!"
"Zoé"|"Chloé"|-0.334572553634644|" Are you through? This is all just part of my plan! I trick Dupain-Cheng into thinking I'm her friend, and tonight at the Barge I'll throw her disgusting macarons into the Seine, in front of all of her friends! Total humiliation."
"Chloé"|"Zoé"|0.677722573280334|"Brilliant! Utterly brilliant!So, how about 'stick a wad of chewing gum on her chair'? No, done that. Oh! 'Get her punished for something she didn't do'! Too easy.Roaches!Roaches in her locker! Yes!How amazing am I?Hey!Where are you going?!"
"Zoé"|"André"|0.692996859550476|" I'm...going to try them on outside.I want to see the diamonds sparkle in the sunlight."

"André"|"Zoé"|0.62615430355072|"When I was young, I wanted to make movies,tell stories. Ah, that was the real me.But it made very clear to me that in order to earn my place,I had to let certain dreams go.What about you? What are your dreams?"
"Zoé"|"André"|-0.350068151950836|" At first, I– I wanted to be an actress.I'm good at acting. Then I found myself acting all the time, playing these different roles trying to please everyone, until I couldn't do it anymore.I just want to be accepted for being me, the real me.And now it's happening all over again, I just can't..."

"Zoé"|"Mylène"|-0.606067597866058|" I'm... really sorry about today. I thought that if I did everything Chloé wanted me to, she'd accept me. I just wanted to meet my family's expectations. Which is why I left New York in the first place. At the boarding school, I was playing a part; being someone else, hoping they'd accept me. But finally, I just couldn't anymore. That's when everyone turned against me, and one day, I found roaches in my locker. They all said I was a loser. Maybe they were right. I get that I'm different, and... I'd understand if you guys didn't want me as a friend."
"Mylène"|"Rose"|0.732059955596924|" We're all one big, happy family. "
"Rose"|"Marinette"|-0.364915370941162|" You'll be fine with us!"

"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.669418781995773|"Wait, wait... What is she doing? Ew! Don't eat that! You're going to get infected with her lameness!I order you to fire her! "
"Chloé"|"André"|-0.100226700305939|"Daddy! Order her to return my shoes at once!And I demand she be sent back to New York immediately! Exactly the way she came!"
"André"|"Audrey"|0.0813456773757935|" Of course, of course! However, uh..."
"Audrey"|"André"|-0.782673865556717|" Is there a problem, André?"
"André"|"Chloé"|-0.572058081626892|" Well, what I mean is: with all the paperwork needed to enrol her in another boarding school, we won't be rid of her for months. Maybe we could just, er... put her somewhere else...?"
"Chloé"|"André"|-0.655033975839615|"In the cellar."
"André"|"Chloé"|0.323700428009033|" Excellent idea, in the cellar. Or at least a room in another wing of the hotel...?"
"Chloé"|"André"|-0.115693747997284|" Well! A smaller room than mine!"
"André"|"Chloé"|-0.517639398574829|" Of course! Miniscule. Barely even the size of a junior suite!"
"Chloé"|"André"|-0.0449268817901611|" And see to it that we never cross paths again!"

"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.657713204622269|" It's not like I'll be able to go anyway."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.28615391254425|" What field trip?"
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.386180639266968|" Oh, the whole class is taking the train to London tomorrow to see Big Ben. But if Hawk Moth creates a supervillain while I'm away, Cat Noir won't be able to capture the Akuma on his own, which means I have to stay. Too bad, tough life of a superhero, besides I'm too exhausted to go anyway."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.458269476890564|" Wait, the Horse Miraculous can be used to teleport back to Paris in the event of an Akuma situation. "
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.600674629211426|" That's so cool! Thank you, Master."
"Master Fu"|"Adrien"|0.743891596794128|" Ladybug definitely deserves a bit of fun, just like all young people her age."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.214259803295135|" See you tonight!Hawk Moth already struck last night, so there's no chance there'll be another Akumatization today."

"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.575088500976562|" Technically not, because I didn't tell him about this one!"
"Nino"|"Claudie"|0.177016258239746|" That's sneaky smart, my dude. "
"Claudie"|"Alya"|0.475369095802307|" The operator must keep his or her hand on here throughout the whole journey between Paris and London. It's called the Deadman switch and -"

"Claudie"|"Marinette"|-0.621465593576431|" The train would come to a stop."
"Marinette"|"Claudie"|-0.256069123744965|" Even for just a second?"
"Claudie"|"Max"|-0.613842099905014|" It's the safety switch in case the operator feels faint, for example."
"Max"|"Markov"|-0.290722012519836|" That's why I've always loved traveling with my mom by train. Trains get from point A to B within the given time they're programmed, and they're safe."

"Kid Passenger"|"Passenger Jean-Pierre"|0.390443921089172|" Daddy, do you think Ladybug will come?"
"Passenger Jean-Pierre"|"Chloé"|-0.671522378921509|" Of course not, sweetie. I'm sure there isn't an Akuma on board at all. It's probably just some prank. "
"Chloé"|"Simon"|-0.494080305099487|" Your daddy doesn't have a clue. It really is an Akuma."
"Simon"|"Sabrina"|0.0380609035491943|" It's definitely an Akuma. I should know, I was once akumatized myself!"
"Sabrina"|"Nino"|-0.233923852443695|" There's zero risk to anyone now, anyway. Since the amazing Queen Bee has shut the car doors, taking the akuma prisoner!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.683751583099365|" Nothin' there."
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.33271849155426|" Probably just Chloé needing some attention again."
"Nino"|"Smart Watch"|0.0468845367431641|" C'mon, let's head back to our seats. "
"Smart Watch"|"Claudie"|-0.725068211555481|" You have no new emails."
"Claudie"|"Startrain"|-0.705285757780075|" That's impossible! I can't have failed! I'll never be an astronaut.Who cares about the results of that stupid exam? I can become an astronaut - right here and now! "
"Startrain"|"Max"|0.643008708953857|"Ladies and gentlemen, I am Startrain!You all get to live my dream with me! Shoot off the rails, and fly off in a rocket to explore not just the moon, but the entire universe!"
"Max"|"Startrain"|-0.416328847408295|" Mom!?"
"Startrain"|"Various Passengers"|0.395859599113464|"Fasten your seatbelts! We have liftoff!"
"Various Passengers"|"Kim"|0.324284553527832|" Wow! Whoa!"
"Kim"|"Juleka"|-0.140422880649567|" See, I was right to change into my swimming trunks!"
"Juleka"|"Alya"|0.123378992080688|"This... is... spacy!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.654599994421005|" I don't think Ladybug and Cat Noir are gonna make it up here to save us!"
"Marinette"|"Nathalie"|-0.18289178609848|" Uh, maybe we can persuade your mom to change back, Max? "
"Nathalie"|"Nadja Chamack"|0.514198780059814|" Sir. You should take a look at this. "
"Nadja Chamack"|"Gabriel"|0.715128064155579|" An observation satellite took these amazing photos earlier. "
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.772948235273361|" So, that's why I lost touch with my akuma! It's too far out of range."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.671546787023544|" There's another problem. Adrien's class is on the train, and your son is on the passenger list!"
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.732508778572083|" He's up in space! And there's nothing I can do."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.0481088161468506|" I'm sure Ladybug and Cat Noir will rescue him."
"Gabriel"|"Max"|-0.418554186820984|" Hoping that my enemies will save my son... How ironic."
"Max"|"Startrain"|-0.416328847408295|" Mom!"
"Startrain"|"Max"|0.205474376678467|"Max! You see this!? I'm Startrain!"
"Max"|"Startrain"|-0.320185899734497|" You have to take us back down to Earth. You can go into space once you pass the exam!"
"Startrain"|"Marinette"|0.737136840820312|"Why? Now I have a hundred percent chance of traveling the universe! And I get to take you with me, too! Isn't this fantastic?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.110109210014343|" We must get to the operator's cabin to take control of the train, and drive it back home. "
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.343193471431732|" And, how do you plan on taking down the super-villain?"
"Nino"|"Chloé"|-0.297298014163971|" No one here has any super powers!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.115063965320587|" No, but you do have a super-heroine with you!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.642681837081909|" We have two things in our favor: the element of surprise, and the fact that there are a lot of us!"
"Adrien"|"Startrain"|0.384201169013977|" Good point, Marinette. "
"Startrain"|"Marinette"|-0.275482654571533|"Oh, where do you think you're going? Don't you wanna sit back and relax!I don't want anyone to get hurt! So stay in your seats and enjoy the view!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.662205547094345|"No peace for Ladybug, obviously."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir "|-0.203119039535522|" Tikki, spots on! Yeah!"
"Cat Noir "|"Ladybug"|0.0712484121322632|" Ladybug? But, how did you get here?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.611286759376526|" Teleportation! Courtesy of the Horse Miraculous. And, you?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.147693455219269|" I... was already on the train! Lucky, huh? Just like what they say about black cats?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.497628748416901|" No one must know that you were one of the passengers! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.0465522408485413|" There're hundreds of people on the train! I'm just a cat in a hay stack."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.557787239551544|" Well, I guess you're right. Let's go and stop Startrain! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.132394433021545|" Why don't we use the Horse Miraculous to teleport the train back to Earth?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.693723261356354|" That would be pointless. She could make the train take off again just as quickly. We must capture the Akuma first!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.446533679962158|" But if we do it while the train's up here in space, we'll all freeze and have no air to breathe."
"Ladybug"|"Classmates"|0.209824919700623|" Which is why we must first reach Startrain, then capture the Akuma, and teleport back to Earth at the same time! "
"Classmates"|"Alya"|-0.133403420448303|" Ladybug? Cat Noir?"
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.215221166610718|"Have you been on the train with us the whole time?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.610431432723999|" Of course not! We teleported here using a special Miraculous."
"Cat Noir"|"Miss Bustier"|0.571966171264648|"We're handling this. Gather everyone together at the back of the train, please."
"Miss Bustier"|"Chloé"|0.503582954406738|" Of course. Everyone, please follow me to the back of the train. "
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|0.717383742332458|" I hope you remembered to bring my miraculous."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.64820659160614|" Uh... actually..."
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.413588345050812|" We... didn't know you were going to be here, otherwise we would've, for sure."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.166563272476196|" Reinforced plexiglass! Unbreakable, except for my... Cata - !"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.554194509983063|"No, wait! We might need it when we're face-to-face with Startrain."
"Cat Noir"|"Max"|0.593528747558594|" Max!"
"Max"|"Startrain"|-0.515446186065674|"Huh? "
"Startrain"|"Max"|-0.727944254875183|"Looks like we have some intruders.You better give up if you don't wanna fly too close to the sun! "
"Max"|"Cat Noir"|0.471351742744446|" Got it!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.662870287895203|" Well done!"
"Ladybug"|"Max"|0.325591921806335|" Max! Markov! We need you to come with us to open the next door."
"Max"|"Cat Noir"|-0.282500505447388|" But isn't it too dangerous?"
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|0.587112069129944|" We'll protect you. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.389339029788971|" What's happening?"
"Ladybug"|"Markov"|0.315223097801208|" We gotta be ready for anything! Lucky Charm!I can't find any -"
"Markov"|"Max"|-0.633127421140671|" Max! My circuits are overheating! "
"Max"|"Ladybug"|-0.724129945039749|" What're we gonna do? Markov's having a meltdown!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.273812055587769|" You have to finish the job, otherwise we're all gonna toast inside this car! "
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.283630967140198|" She wasn't kidding, it feels like we're really close to the sun!"
"Cat Noir"|"Markov"|-0.218644618988037|"Wooh! We almost got cooked in there!"
"Markov"|"Max"|-0.408123135566711|" I think we should classify this as a code red situation!"
"Max"|"Cat Noir"|0.598464012145996|"Good job."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.704160928726196|" You two make an awesome pair, too. Just like me and milady."
"Ladybug"|"Markov"|-0.176587820053101|"Markov! Check the oxygen level in the next car."
"Markov"|"Ladybug"|-0.60108807682991|"It's decreasing quickly!"
"Ladybug"|"Max"|-0.789610117673874|" Startrain is creating a void!"
"Max"|"Cat Noir"|-0.320338487625122|" The temperature inside will soon be close to absolute zero!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.570397824048996|" Max won't be able to hold on in these conditions without super powers!"
"Ladybug"|"Max"|0.68591570854187|"Max Kanté, here's the Miraculous of the horse, which grants the power of Teleportation. You will use it for the greater good.Once the job is done, you will return the Miraculous to me. Can I trust you?"
"Max"|"Kaalki"|0.658040761947632|" You count on me one hundred percent, Ladybug. I'll do everything I can to save my friends, and my mom! "
"Kaalki"|"Max"|0.811357617378235|" Oh, to whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?"
"Max"|"Kaalki"|0.673155188560486|" Uh, hello! My name's Max."
"Kaalki"|"Ladybug"|0.613987922668457|" Are you glorious and famous?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.541170954704285|" Kaalki! We don't have time for that! Max is perfect for the job, trust me. We're going to the last car, to the door leading to the driver's cab, that's where Startrain is."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.444817423820496|" Gonna have to be fast and in sync."
"Ladybug"|"Max"|0.0415674448013306|" While I handle Startrain and Cat Noir uses his Cataclysm, we need you, Max, to teleport the train back to Earth! So that I can summon up my Miraculous Ladybug, so everything gets fixed!"
"Max"|"Kaalki"|0.471351742744446|" Got it!"
"Kaalki"|"Max"|-0.436473488807678|" All you need to say is:'Kaalki, full gallop!' "
"Max"|"Pegasus"|-0.276841819286346|" Kaalki, full gallop!"
"Pegasus"|"Startrain"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Startrain"|"Startrain"|-0.230610430240631|"I was expecting you - my dear, super passengers. You can't stop me from living out my galactic dream, I shall conquer the universe!"

"Smart Watch"|"Max"|0.246241807937622|" You have one new email."
"Max"|"Claudie"|0.135955810546875|" Hey, mom! "
"Claudie"|"Max"|0.176970720291138|"I passed!"
"Max"|"Nino"|0.621939420700073|"I told you, mom! You're the best! That's one hundred percent certain."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.493368983268738|"I'm gettin' the feeling that was your first, and last, field trip."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.528428196907043|" That's okay. At least, I got to see Big Ben, right?"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.597126722335815|" Sure did! No one's seen it as close up as we did! Too bad we got separated at the end."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.689229488372803|" We'll go back there together some day.See ya."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.763900995254517|"Oh, no! Poor Adrien! This trip was a total disaster."
"Alya"|"Master Fu"|-0.750497713685036|" A total disaster? Really? "
"Nadja"|"André"|-0.738042563199997|"The stone beings are scattered all over Paris, and for the time being, they are showing no signs of movement.Police have cordoned off the area."
"André"|"Nadja"|-0.657148092985153|"We won't stop until we find a way to get these people back to their normal selves, but for now, we're not making much headway."
"Nadja"|"Tom"|0.357596039772034|" Paris is relying on our new guardian angels, Ladybug and Cat Noir, to save us all. Our lives depend on them."
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.535525143146515|"Listen, I know how upsetting and scary this is, but don't worry, sweetie; we've got two superheroes looking out for Paris, and the best way of helping them is to show them that we're not scared, because we trust them. "
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.596767097711563|" But what if Ladybug fails? "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.316364645957947|" Then I'd come and save you.Super Baker to the rescue!"

"Gabriel"|"Plagg"|-0.635313242673874|"You didn't see him leave? If anything has happened to my son, you'll be held responsible!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.580710977315903|" You're such a strange kid. Who would want to be at school when he can stay at home all day?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.599849194288254|" You don't get it, Plagg. I've had enough of being shut up at home by my dad. I want to meet people and make friends! Go to a normal school like everyone else!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.706823229789734|"Uhhh, I think I'm feeling weak…"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.743344157934189|" You know what's strange?The fact that all you eat is this disgusting, rotten-smelling Camembert cheese, and then I have to smell like it 24/7. That's strange. "
"Plagg"|"Alya"|0.00625979900360107|"If you want to be able to transform into a superhero, then stinky cheese is the deal, my friend! "

"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.0553339719772339|"She's gonna handle 'em."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.692614853382111|" But what if she's not really cut out to be a superhero even though everyone thinks she is?"
"Alya"|"Alix"|-0.202422618865967|" What are you talking about, girl? Oh, wait.I know what this is about.You're scared, but don't be! I've seen her with my own two eyes, girl! Ladybug is a true superheroine! She's going to protect us all! I believe in her. "
"Alix"|"Juleka"|-0.730344921350479|"So you really don't remember anything?"
"Juleka"|"Kim"|-0.167379200458527|" You were totally going ballistic. It was so cool!"
"Kim"|"Ivan"|-0.45952707529068|" You were seriously out to crush me, dude!"

"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|-0.586254864931107|" Adrien! Don't do this! Your father will be furious!"
"Adrien"|"Alya"|-0.264417111873627|" Tell him you got here too late. Please!"
"Alya"|"Chloé"|0.0745398998260498|" How could you say that to Ivan? You're the real Stoneheart."
"Chloé"|"Alya"|-0.577047497034073|" Ugh, so I'm the one who broke Sabrina's dad's arm, am I? Just because your footage of those lame superheroes was shown on TV, doesn't mean you have to get so high and mighty. "
"Alya"|"Chloé"|-0.659934610128403|" You little…"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|-0.708200216293335|" Look out, she's angry! She's going to split her underwear and turn into a huge muscly monster! "
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.309791564941406|" Hey, Chloé!"
"Chloé"|"Nathalie"|-0.307809948921204|" Adrikins! You came!"
"Nathalie"|"Marinette"|-0.139858961105347|"I'll handle it."
"Marinette"|"Ivan"|0.0346417427062988|" You know, you should tell Mylène how you feel."
"Ivan"|"Marinette"|-0.633243083953857|" I… don't know what you're talking about."
"Marinette"|"Ivan"|0.506831407546997|" Come on, I saw the way you look at her. No! No negative emotions, Ivan. What I mean is, be positive. I'm sure Mylène has feelings for you too. Go talk to her."
"Ivan"|"Marinette"|-0.658831119537354|" I'm no good with words anyway."
"Marinette"|"Ivan"|0.235614895820618|" But… who needs words? You could draw her a picture, send her flowers…"
"Ivan"|"Marinette"|0.526423573493958|" I could… write her a song?"
"Marinette"|"Hawk Moth"|0.604989886283875|" That's a great idea! What girl wouldn't want a love song written especially for her? Go for it, Ivan, and, uh–, stay positive."

"Chloé"|"Adrien"|0.472154498100281|" Wow. This is your seat, Adrikins. I saved it for you. Right in front of me!"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|0.66086483001709|" Thanks, Chloé.Uh… Hey! Adrien. "
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.104738116264343|" You're friends with Chloé, then, huh?"
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.0900311470031738|"Hey! What's that all about?"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|-0.513186305761337|" The brats that sat here yesterday need a little attitude adjustment. I'm just commanding a bit of respect, that's all."
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|-0.22259509563446|" You think that's really necessary?"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.700395464897156|" Ah, you've got a lot to learn about school culture, Adrikins. Watch the master."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.104391276836395|" Alya, wouldn't you like to be a superhero and go out and fight monsters and villains?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.34843498468399|" Totally! I'm not scared of anyone! Why?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.649240404367447|" Oh! No reason… "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.352640628814697|" Hey! What are you doing?"

"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.00586223602294922|" Okay. I get it. Good job, you three. Very funny."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.559812188148499|" No, no, I was just trying to take this off!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.420140624046326|" Oh, really?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.253360748291016|" You're friends with Chloé, right?"
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|-0.614272028207779|" Why do people keep saying that? "
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.48829174041748|" Now do you see what I mean about respect?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.744128584861755|" I know I've seen him somewhere before.Of course! He's the son of my fave fashion designer, Gabriel Agreste!"

"Cat Noir"|"Mylène"|-0.293382823467255|" Ugh. Not really following you, but guess I better trust you. Something tells me that this is how it's gonna be from here on out."

"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.71963307261467|" Chloé might not be completely wrong, you know, Tikki! I haven't changed.

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.303976774215698|" You are not, Marinette! You've changed a lot since the beginning of the year and since you first met Adrien!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.307526588439941|" You're right! I have changed. I got more and more clumsy since I met him!"
"Tikki"|"Tikki"|-0.586760878562927|" No!"

"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|-0.271181344985962|" Yes, but he’s reserved the best seats in the house for you, Adrien. Front row."
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|0.689454197883606|" As usual. The best money can buy."
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|0.488792538642883|" The fencing hall is booked for 6:05 p.m. and the Chinese classroom for 6:35 p.m. just as you wished. And remember that you have to make an appearance at the Agreste Foundation’s Heroes Gala tonight."
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|0.646050095558167|" I’ll be there, for sure. "
"Nathalie"|"Nathalie"|-0.391668856143951|" As I've watched Emilie falling deeper into an endless sleep, my sadness for her has deepened, too. And little by little…"
"Nathalie"|"Hawk Moth"|0.678111553192139|" …my admiration for Gabriel, a man who do anything for his family, has turned into something more. I never thought I would have feelings like this. I would do anything for Gabriel Agreste, no matter the cost."
"Hawk Moth"|"Nathalie"|0.613942503929138|" Are you ready, Nathalie?"
"Nathalie"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.357884526252747|"They've been keeping you from achieving your dream for way too long. I will go to any lengths to end the reign of Ladybug and Cat Noir."
"Hawk Moth"|"Gabriel"|0.569373607635498|" Good."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.114521741867065|" Nathalie, are you alright?"
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.517960786819458|"Yes. Thank you, sir."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.444616854190826|" I feel a strong negative emotion. We’ll finish this later. "
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.0311154723167419|"I have to tell you how amazing this photoshoot was, Dad.I'm sorry, Father. It was very interesting."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.0322971343994141|" You’ll tell me all about it later, Adrien. I'm busy at the moment."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.511186003684998|" In that case, can I go out and meet up with my friends?"
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|0.300096035003662|" You'll see them at school tomorrow. "
"Gabriel"|"Nooroo"|-0.629069298505783|" This negative emotion I'm feeling… it's familiar."
"Nooroo"|"Gabriel"|-0.467297255992889|" Maybe it's your son’s emotion. You should spend more time with him."
"Gabriel"|"Nooroo"|0.730877757072449|" I'm doing all of this so that he can be happy again."
"Nooroo"|"Nathalie"|-0.477129876613617|" But aren't you in danger of losing him if you continue down this path?"
"Nathalie"|"Nooroo"|-0.474294781684875|" Your father is very busy."
"Nooroo"|"Gabriel"|-0.320551097393036|" Your Miraculous was not intended to be used in this way, Master."
"Gabriel"|" Gabriel"|-0.522429287433624|" I forbid you to talk to me like that, Nooroo. "
" Gabriel"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.0202228426933289|" Nooroo, dark wings rise!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|-0.357559442520142|" What if Nooroo is right? Am I taking too many risks?"
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.0209701061248779|" You have to trust me!"
"Adrien"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.730008780956268|" Always!Yeah-ha!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.586760878562927|"No!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.345000863075256|" I no longer have a choice. I must succeed, at any price.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize her!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Aurore"|0.509027242660522|"Stormy Weather. People have told you that you'll never change? Well, they're right. People don't change, they grow! This time, your powers will be even stronger as you know them well. Show them how you're able to control all the forces of nature."
"Aurore"|"Adrien"|0.0849698781967163|" Alright, Hawk Moth. "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.62260827422142|"My father will never change."
"Plagg"|"Plagg"|0.57194721698761|" I like people who never change. That way you always know what to expect."
"Plagg"|"Plagg"|-0.0101129412651062|" Look at me."
"Plagg"|"Plagg"|0.595076203346252|" I love eating cheese."
"Plagg"|"Plagg"|-0.623093664646149|" Why would I change that?"
"Plagg"|"Plagg"|-0.52940046787262|" I wouldn't be myself..."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.214997708797455|" ...anymore if I did."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.35874879360199|" Does this mean my life will never change?"
"Plagg"|"Plagg"|-0.590947479009628|" 'Course not, don't worry. Think of everything that's happened since the end of last summer."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.31497049331665|" You're finally going to school. And you know I still find it weird for a boy your age to love going to school so much when you could just stay at home."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.57338085770607|" I was tired of being cooped up at home, never seeing anyone, all because of my father. I met a lot of friends at school."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.133727014064789|" See? You've already started to change."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.62407448887825|" But father still hasn't."
"Plagg"|"Plagg"|-0.216737031936646|" You sure about that?"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.720281034708023|" He didn't punish you after you went to the movies with that girl all by yourself."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.247371792793274|" True. We even watched mother's movie together instead."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.192732453346252|" And you played a duet on the piano with him, didn't you?"
"Adrien"|"Rose"|0.71945858001709|" And he allowed me to meet my friends afterwards."
"Rose"|"Adrien"|0.684928894042969|" : I love unicorns, and cute little fluffy cats."
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.798286318778992|" And for once, his birthday gift to me was amazing."
"Adrien"|"Alya"|0.115031003952026|"Hey, dude!"
"Alya"|"Adrien"|0.518113851547241|" Yo! Nice scarf, Adrien. Off the chain."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|0.63695502281189|" Yeah, can you believe my dad got this for me?It's so awesome. He's given me the same lame pen for three years in a row."
"Nino"|"Plagg"|-0.0311771631240845|" Wow, I guess anyone can change. Adults can be cool when you least expect it."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.47578763961792|" Your father's like one of those wheels of cheese with a very thick rind. Once you manage to sink your teeth into it, you realize it's all soft inside. Or slightly rotten."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.669452846050262|" Plagg, you're really gross. But you're right. Thank you. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.773767158389091|" It's not me! I swear I didn't use my Cataclysm!"
"Adrien"|" Adrien"|-0.107019484043121|"What is that?"
" Adrien"|"Stormy Weather"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Stormy Weather"|"Cat Noir"|0.37040102481842|" I'm going to use this volcano to move the Earth away from the sun. Soon the world will plunge into a perpetual winter, and Earthlings will be nothing but frozen food. Then you'll realize just how powerful I really am. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.464310884475708|" Can she really do that?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.606494635343552|" Probably. But don't worry, kitty. We're not gonna let her rain on Paris' parade."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.359230399131775|" Hey! Was that a pun I heard, m'lady?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.549141407012939|" Yep. A little change is good, don't you think? "
"Cat Noir"|"Nadja"|0.666343688964844|" I love that girl! "
"Nadja"|"Nino"|-0.499380528926849|" Don't be bemused, it's just the news. Astronauts that orbit around the earth have confirmed that our planet has shifted on its axis, and it’s moving away from the sun!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.407588481903076|" Stormy Weather seems way stronger than the first time around."
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.710690647363663|" And it's that brat Chloé's fault again! "
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.454343616962433|" If only things go back to the way they were before, before Hawk Moth and all those villains."
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.0128437280654907|" You mean before we met?"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.427501261234283|" No, of course not. I didn't mean it that way!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.348940551280975|" It's weird to think of it, but if it wasn't for Hawk Moth, you and I might not be here right now."
"Nino"|"Nino"|-0.438722729682922|" Actually..."
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|0.350621223449707|" ...it's thanks to Ladybug we're together."
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.0310343503952026|" Stay put and you'll be safe."
"Alya"|"Alya"|0.701466202735901|" True, and for becoming superheroes too."
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.0850443243980408|" Both of us."
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.584314823150635|"Rena Rouge and Carapace, I need you both!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.286983251571655|"You're Rena Rouge?"
"Alya"|"Alya"|0.445478081703186|" Of course I am."
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.371697425842285|" Trixx, let's pounce!"
"Nino"|"Nino"|0.74618136882782|" So awesome!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.110806405544281|" Wayzz, shell on!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.328658938407898|" I suspected you’re a Carapace from the very beginning."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.498686492443085|" So there's nothing I can hide from you?"
"Alya"|"Ella and Etta"|-0.71704113483429|" You've always been a terrible liar."
"Ella and Etta"|"Nora"|-0.642581403255463|" Alya, Nino! They’re going to make the weather bad, she’s too scary! Protect us!"
"Nora"|"Nino"|-0.186531782150269|" Come on, fly weights! No need to worry, I'll protect you. "
"Nino"|"Chloé"|-0.588186353445053|" Well, one thing's for sure, we aren't going anywhere."
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|0.551260232925415|" What is she doing? She needs to come and give me my Miraculous right now. I did it best super hero of them all"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|0.222564339637756|" Yes, of course you are, Chloé!"
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.730003207921982|" Nobody's nicer than me."
"Sabrina"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.163045167922974|" So true, Chloé."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Chloé"|-0.717565566301346|" Since no one is owning up, the whole school will be punished. "
"Chloé"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.595561414957047|" What?! I'm not so sure my father will react kindly to me being punished without any proof. gets out her phone, preparing to call her dad"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Chloé"|-0.750248774886131|" Oh, no! Please, don't disrupt the busy mayor.The whole school is punished except for Miss Bourgeois! "
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.0867912173271179|" Sabrina, who? I don't know any Sabrina."
"Sabrina"|"Butler Jean"|0.195897936820984|" But, of course you do, Chloé. It's me.Your BFF! "
"Butler Jean"|"Chloé"|0.680270075798035|" You should talk to her, Mademoiselle. She's right here."
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.593807250261307|"I don't see anyone."
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.670342922210693|" I just don't understand why she's not coming!"
"Sabrina"|"Ladybug"|-0.547757595777512|" Especially since she could have never defeated Despair Bear without you."
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|0.110627770423889|"Chloé, would you be so kind? "
"Chloé"|"Cat Noir"|0.0160232782363892|" Okay, Ladybug! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.0531717538833618|" Ladybug? What are you doing?"
"Ladybug"|"Sabrina"|-0.383946776390076|" Oh, nothing. Just saving your skin with the help of our new little sidekick."
"Sabrina"|"Queen Bee"|0.114403247833252|" Then there are the times when you were the awesome Queen Bee."
"Queen Bee"|"Ladybug"|0.334785580635071|" I've always dreamed of doing this… with you!"
"Ladybug"|"Queen Bee"|0.621531367301941|" We must work together as a team, all right, Queen Bee?"
"Queen Bee"|"Queen Bee"|-0.790535092353821|" Venom!"
"Queen Bee"|"Chloé and Ladybug"|-0.318798542022705|"Your turn, Ladybug. "
"Chloé and Ladybug"|"Sabrina"|-0.271977782249451|"Pound it!"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|-0.295193672180176|" You really are the best of the best, and Ladybug such a laney for being a no-show."
"Chloé"|"Stormy Weather"|-0.548775613307953|" Hey, stop it! Don't talk about Ladybug like that.Finally. Huh?"
"Stormy Weather"|"Chloé"|-0.176896512508392|" So, Chloé Bourgeois, you still think my power is utterly ridiculous?"
"Chloé"|"Stormy Weather"|-0.733293473720551|" Ugh, this is just proof that I was right: Once a villain, always a villain. "
"Stormy Weather"|"Ladybug"|-0.279545724391937|" You’ll never defeat me!"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.305019974708557|"Ouch. It's true, she really is a lot stronger than before..."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.483399510383606|" ...but we're also stronger than before. Cat Noir and I have gotten to know one another better,"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.3462073802948|" and we've learned how to fight together."
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.406260013580322|" We still don't know where his akuma is hidden."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.729554295539856|" This might be a good time to use that Lucky Charm of yours, don't you think?"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.344958126544952|" I need all of us to make it work! I can't do anything with it now! "
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.00521135330200195|"Over to you, Cat Noir."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0455138683319092|" We are Ladybug..."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.353950083255768|" ...and Cat Noir! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0681295394897461|" We've learned to trust each other. Spots off. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.454914927482605|" Claws in."
"Ladybug"|"Marinette"|0.403181195259094|" And now, we have new super powers!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.311140775680542|" Aqua-Tikki, spots on! Yeah! "
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.75150591135025|" Plagg-glacier, claws out! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.535159826278687|" After all, we've been through a lot together. We're not gonna let Stormy Weather defeat us, right, kitty?"
"Cat Noir"|"Nadja"|-0.0174473524093628|" As usual, I completely agree with you, Bugaboo."
"Nadja"|"Clara"|5.4478645324707e-05|" The further the Earth moves away from the Sun, the colder the temperatures will get. You're outside right now, Clara. How’s it going?"
"Clara"|"Nadja"|0.231507301330566|" We're down to minus 40 degrees Celsius, Nadja. It's getting very difficult but Ladybug and Cat Noir have donned their specialized suits, so they can battle Stormy Weather on an equal playing field. "
"Nadja"|"Clara"|-0.714325815439224|" Everything okay, Clara? The picture's gone down."
"Clara"|"Ella and Etta"|-0.454456269741058|" The freezing temperatures have just cracked the camera, but I can view the battle. Everything's fine, Nadja. Icebug just called up her Lucky Charm. She’s got a small object - it looks like a pencil. What’s she going to do with that?"
"Ella and Etta"|"Clara"|0.250758290290833|" Is Ladybug gonna do some coloring?"
"Clara"|"Ella and Etta"|-0.41225677728653|" Cat Noir is holding up a copy machine, I can't see much, but it- it looks like Ladybug is making a photocopy.Whoa! That was a huge flash! Wait, Stormy Weather has been defeated!"
"Ella and Etta"|"Chloé"|0.484487056732178|"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah."
"Chloé"|"Hawk Moth"|0.267437100410461|"Queen Bee would have done it a thousand times better and faster."
"Hawk Moth"|"Tikki"|0.476186275482178|" One of these days, I'll send you both into orbit, Ladybug and Cat Noir! "
"Tikki"|"Nathalie"|0.451051712036133|" You can do it, Marinette!"
"Nathalie"|"Marinette"|0.299741506576538|" Yes?"
"Marinette"|"Nathalie"|0.621201157569885|" Hello, I'm Marinette, and I'm in Adrien's class. I'm bringing him the schoolwork that he missed today, and the homework that is due tomorrow.You tell him it's from Marinette, his friend from school, and that I did it as a friend to help him, okay?"
"Nathalie"|"Marinette"|0.107585191726685|" I will."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.695146322250366|" See you tomorrow at school, love your friend, Marinette. "
"Tikki"|"Adrien"|0.304773449897766|" Good job! We've got ourselves a new and improved Marinette."
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.796324133872986|" She's really so amazing and classy."
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.531918942928314|" She has always been that way. She never changes."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.596159934997559|" She's just so Ladybug."
"Plagg"|"Ladybug"|-0.615832030773163|" You mean like the time she stood you up after you invited her on a romantic date on a Paris rooftop, or when she told you that she was in love with someone else?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.682444512844086|" I don't wanna play around with your feelings. It would be the same as lying to you. I don't wanna do that. You're more than a partner, Cat Noir. You're my friend. And I'd never wanna lie to a friend."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.66464376449585|" But why do you think it'd be lying?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.450666427612305|" Because there's this boy, I..."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.390639066696167|" There's a boy? Who is...?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.266173779964447|" It's— I can't tell you who it is. We can't know anything about each other. Our identities must remain a secret. We're both superheroes, Cat Noir. We don't have a choice."
"Cat Noir"|"Plagg"|0.635842680931091|" I get it, Ladybug. Your friendship means everything to me.You can keep the rose. It goes with your costume."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.551123291254044|" Why don't you look for another girl to love, one who's actually available? "
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|-0.575916290283203|"The heart wants what the heart wants, Plagg. You can't just change your feelings just like that.Yes?"
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|0.385793924331665|" Your friend from school, Marinette, just brought you these lessons you missed today. She copied them out for you by hand; she wanted me to tell you she did it for you as a friend to help you."
"Adrien"|"Adrien and Marinette"|0.600894331932068|" Thank you, Nathalie."
"Adrien and Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.695146322250366|" See you tomorrow at school. Love, your friend, Marinette."
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.475313544273376|" I'd never noticed, Marinette's writing. Remember this unsigned card I got on Valentine's Day?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.640072226524353|"Whoa, hold up! Someone answered my poem? But I threw it away!\"Your hair shines like the sun, your eyes are gorgeous green, I look at you and wonder your innermost thoughts and dreams. Yes, your Valentine I will be, our love will be so true, together for eternity, my heart belongs to you.\" "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.664879202842712|" Aww, well, anyone who writes as sickeningly sweet as you must be your soulmate."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.125151634216309|" Of course, it couldn't have been from Ladybug. It had to have been from someone at school, but Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.604314625263214|"Phew! Hopefully, he didn't see me!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.633583903312683|" Hey, Marinette!How's it going? After what happened at your place last night, I was worried that—"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.0978565216064453|"Oh, so you watched the show, then!Well, uh, look...about what you saw on the show last night — the totographs, in my room—"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.254775762557983|" You mean the photographs?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.199288606643677|"The grotographs, exactly!It-it's not what you think.See...I'm really into fashion, and, umm..."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.605746299028397|"Are you lying?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.571550905704498|" No! I'm so not into you—I mean, sure, I'm interested in you, but, um, not in that way; well, you know, ha-ha-ha-ha...ha ha!"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.693148970603943|"Just teasing.I understand; don't worry."
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.315213084220886|" No, Marinette couldn't possibly be in love with me, she's just a friend who loves fashion. Besides, there's Luka."
"Adrien"|"Alya"|0.216762661933899|" It's just someone with similar writing, that's all."
"Alec"|"Aurore"|0.56971549987793|" Welcome to the finals of our KIDZ+ competition! When today, one lucky winner will be announced as our brand new KIDZ+ weather girl!"

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.741530507802963|"That's the problem with you. You never want to take any risks."

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.494272589683533|" Do you think this villain is the reason why people are acting unusual?"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.55405980348587|" Maybe. All I know is that we won't be able to defeat him if we keep having to save people all the time. I'll go for reinforcements. Stall him!"

"Nathalie"|"Ladybug"|0.594424962997437|" Sir? "
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.614890456199646|" Phew! There you are. I'm sorry I thought I told you we were supposed to meet up."
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.362155556678772|" Meet up?"
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|0.240293383598328|" Yes, so you could give it back to me."
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.331940054893494|" Give what back to you?"
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|0.759686231613159|" Well, the Miraculous of the dog."
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.707029402256012|" But you didn't give me anything."
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.0284613966941833|" Of course, I did! On the train."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.364359140396118|" The train? ...Félix!"
"Gabriel"|"Flairmidable"|0.319472551345825|" What do you want, Félix?"
"Flairmidable"|"Gabriel"|0.666532874107361|" I want the real Peacock Miraculous. And you’re going to give it to me."
"Gabriel"|"Flairmidable"|-0.633243083953857|" I don't know what you're talking about."
"Flairmidable"|"Gabriel"|0.444390177726746|" Do you want me to tell Adrien about the secret code on the painting? Then, give me what I ask for and I'll give you something better in exchange."
"Gabriel"|"Flairmidable"|0.549423575401306|" Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous?"
"Flairmidable"|"Gabriel"|-0.150296628475189|" No. All the other Miraculous. And this. I won't be needing it anymore. As long as Ladybug hasn't de-transformed, I only have to say one word and her yo-yo, the magic portal to the Miraculous, will be yours. Make up your mind, time is ticking. "
"Gabriel"|"Flairmidable"|-0.446095108985901|" How do I know that you won't use the Peacock Miraculous against us?"
"Flairmidable"|"Gabriel"|-0.591657608747482|" If I wanted to harm you, uncle, I would've done it a long time ago. "
"Gabriel"|"Flairmidable"|-0.738618552684784|"Duusu, I renounce you. "
"Flairmidable"|"Gabriel"|0.483563780784607|" Fetch!"
"Gabriel"|"Ladybug"|-0.612532168626785|"Ah! You've lost, Ladybug! Finally!"
"Ladybug"|"Gabriel"|0.618706345558167|"The ball... of the dog... Félix... He has the yo-yo, and that means... he has the Miraculous!"
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.675865411758423|"My greatest wish will finally come true!"
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.566712290048599|"Ladybug, try to keep calm. Think. There must be a way to get your yo-yo back."
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|0.338251113891602|" Yes, maybe if I transform back and then—"
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.0344467163085938|" Go ahead,you'll be safe here."
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.38173109292984|" I-I don't know anymore, I— What if this is a trap? What if you're Félix?"
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.164696514606476|" If you're gonna trust me once, please let it be this time! "
"Ladybug"|"Marinette"|-0.683466970920563|"Spots off.. "
"Marinette"|"Flairmidable"|-0.388212323188782|" Please hurry, Tikki.We can't let them take all the Miraculous, please let there be some left, there has to be some left! "
"Flairmidable"|"Félix"|-0.449226915836334|" Lay down. "
"Félix"|"Tikki"|-0.744773894548416|" Barkk, I renounce you. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.0327961444854736|" I'm done!"

"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.674416363239288|"Ladybug...?"
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.687694191932678|"I've lost...!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|0.187932968139648|" People of Paris, Ladybug had promised to protect you. Well, she lied to you! Behold, her defeat! I took all the Miraculous from her! Now I'm more powerful than ever! From now on, I will be attacking you relentlessly. I would be everywhere probing your thoughts, steal your dreams, harnessing your deepest fears! Whatever damage I can cause, I will not stop! Unless... someone brings me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.702089458703995|"I've lost everything! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.381241142749786|"You haven't lost me."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.765456289052963|" Why don't you just give up on me? I lost all the Miraculous, I'm the worst Guardian ever! I wanted to control everything, I didn't listen to you, I lied to you, I kept you at a distance! Every time you offered me a helping hand, I never took it! I really made a mess of everything!... "
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.111656129360199|"M'lady..."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.490478098392487|" We're gonna get them back one by one, until the very last. And we'll make sure this never happens again!"

"Cat Noir"|"Parisians"|0.55382227897644|" You, the best superhero there ever was,them, the people of Paris..."
"Parisians"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0360684990882874|" Ladybug! Ladybug! Ladybug! Ladybug!"
"Cat Noir"|"Adrien"|0.65375542640686|" And me, your loyal partner."
"Nadja"|"Tikki"|0.729911684989929|"Tonight, the wife, the great and highly respected fashion queen-"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.47629451751709|" Honestly, Marinette, it's perfect the way it is!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.728722512722015|"Oh, Tikki, I don't know… I feel like it's the ugliest hat in the world and Adrien is supposed to model it in front of everyone. He'll resent me for the rest of his life! I have zero talent! And everyone's gonna find that out tonight…"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.467118561267853|" You're a great designer, Marinette. Besides, if your hat was so ugly, why did Gabriel Agreste hand-pick it for his fashion show?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.585675984621048|" But what if people see that it's a synthetic pigeon feather and not a real one? They're gonna think it's lame, aren't they?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.640683710575104|"You did the right thing of replacing it! With that allergy of his, Adrien would be sneezing all the way down the catwalk!"
"Marinette"|"Nadja"|-0.530931204557419|" You're right! Besides, I don't have time to make changes anyway. The show begins in…Oh, no! I'm gonna be late again! Quick, Tikki!"
"Nadja"|"Audrey"|0.647435188293457|" This is it! Here she comes! The international queen of fashion, director of \"Style Queen\" magazine, Audrey Bourgeois! "
"Audrey"|"Chloé"|-0.438548505306244|" Anthony— Uh… André, be a dear and fire the chauffeur. I can't believe Gabriel allows his staff to drive like that! "
"Chloé"|"André"|-0.611477792263031|" And neither do I!"
"André"|"Marinette"|0.65392804145813|" Yes, of course, Audrey, dear."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.477796673774719|" Oh, no! It's Audrey Bourgeois!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.135735332965851|" Who?"
"Marinette"|"Audrey"|-0.746519416570663|" Only the harshest fashion critic in the entire world. I didn't know she was coming!"
"Audrey"|"Marinette"|-0.587988495826721|"What is this carpet? Is it fabric? Why isn't the red carpet made out of marble like I said!You're fired!Ridiculous, utterly ridiculous."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.636670887470245|"She's gonna hate my hat for sure!"
"Tikki"|"Nadja"|-0.578745096921921|" I'm sure she won't! Come on, Marinette! Adrien is waiting for you. "
"Nadja"|"Audrey"|0.673866987228394|" Audrey, like the slogan of your magazine says \"If it's in good taste; it's in \"Style Queen\"!\" So, what's in good taste this year?"
"Audrey"|"Marinette"|-0.296127438545227|" Judging by the way you're dressed, you obviously don't know my dear.For your information, the trend this year is glitter."
"Marinette"|"Nadja"|-0.803985819220543|"Glitter?! There's no glitter on my hat! This is a fashion disaster!"
"Nadja"|"Chloé"|0.468168377876282|" As the editor of Style Queen, you spend a lot of time in New York. It must be nice to be with your family for a change here in Paris."
"Chloé"|"Audrey"|0.801049709320068|" She's very happy to see me. By the way, Mom, I have a little something for you. "
"Audrey"|"Chloé"|-0.0831221342086792|" Clara— Uh… Chloé, what is this?"
"Chloé"|"Audrey"|0.546036720275879|" Um… it's a gift?"
"Audrey"|"André"|-0.80540406703949|" Ugh, this wrapping paper is ridiculous, utterly ridiculous. You're fired."
"André"|"Nadja"|-0.730852454900742|"Darling, please! You can't fire Chloé. She's your daughter!"
"Nadja"|"Audrey"|0.286710381507874|" Audrey, how long are you planning to stay in Paris?"
"Audrey"|"Nadja"|0.708688378334045|" As short as possible time. "
"Nadja"|"Nadja"|0.739428400993347|" Thank you. This fashion show just might be one of the most important in Gabriel Agreste's career, as evidenced by Audrey Bourgeois' presence."
"Nadja"|"Tikki"|-0.341201603412628|"Will the famous fashion designer who never appears in public show up for the occasion? Stay tuned to find out. Don't be bemu— "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.516598343849182|" Where are you going?"
"Marinette"|"Nathalie"|-0.693582534790039|" You heard Audrey Bourgeois, right? They can't let Adrien model this hat! There's not glitter on it! Zero trend-potential!"
"Nathalie"|"Marinette"|0.0124255418777466|" Ah! There you are, Marinette. Everyone's waiting for you."
"Marinette"|"Nathalie"|-0.551974177360535|"Uh— but— uh— actually— I, uh—"
"Nathalie"|"Marinette"|-0.299351513385773|" The dressing rooms are that way. Hurry up, you're late."
"Marinette"|"Audrey"|0.48602294921875|"Okay. "
"Audrey"|"Marinette"|-0.0606554746627808|" What is this?"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.611643075942993|" Uh… "
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.694240063428879|" Uh, Mom, this is Marinette Dupain Cheng, the loser! And this is a hat she made, because she thinks she's a designer.She even signed it, look."
"Marinette"|"Nathalie"|-0.724865674972534|" I— It's not me, it's another Marinette! I was just bringing it to, uh—"
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|-0.0807353258132935|" Marinette! We have to go."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.647570759057999|"I feel awkward."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.797469511628151|"That's probably because you look ridiculous."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.178997755050659|" Hello, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.635493069887161|" Oh, uh— Hallah…"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.673784136772156|" Ooh! Sorry."
"Adrien"|"Marinette and Adrien"|-0.265176475048065|" No worries."
"Marinette and Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.76048643887043|" Sorry."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.762111961841583|" Oh, no! I hope it's not too hard to fix it."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.757824078202248|" Oh, you know, it doesn't really matter. This hat is a complete failure anyway."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.738593101501465|" What? No, it's not.Why would you say that?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.697871416807175|" Because… The queen of fashion, Audrey Bourgeois, saw it and hated it! I'm sorry, Adrien. I really messed up. I'm a total no-talent! Please don't put it on."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.390122950077057|"Marinette, everything's gonna be fine. Your hat looks great; I think it's awesome; so does my father. Otherwise he wouldn't have picked it for me. Look.See?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.151205062866211|"You got that catwalk down!"
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|0.50873863697052|"Really? Thank you."
"Nathalie"|"Tom"|-0.625165015459061|"Ahem! We have to go. "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|-0.33506566286087|" Marinette! Yoo-hoo!"
"Sabine"|"Alya"|-0.718406677246094|" She looks nervous."
"Alya"|"Tom"|0.668872952461243|" No doubt. It's her first fashion show with her first professional piece, and not to mention: Adrien will be modeling it. "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.616064429283142|" I'm sure it'll go just great."
"Sabine"|"Audrey"|0.0493607521057129|"Mmm-hmm!"
"Audrey"|"Alya"|-0.705251395702362|" How dilapidated is this place? And I have to share the front row with this group of low-lifes? Ridiculous!Utterly ridiculous."
"Alya"|"Audrey"|-0.73181027173996|" Uh, sorry, but that seat is reserved for Marinette."
"Audrey"|"Chloé"|-0.00438261032104492|" This Marinette girl, again?"
"Chloé"|"Nathalie"|-0.227308750152588|" Let me handle this, Mother. Hey, losers! Do you know who my mother is? She's Miss Style Queen: the most powerful woman in the world of fashion. This show is for her, okay? So, get lost!"
"Nathalie"|"Audrey"|0.282320618629456|"Mrs. Bourgeois, Mr. Agreste has reserved a seat for you."
"Audrey"|"Nathalie"|0.372029423713684|" Ah, finally! "
"Nathalie"|"Audrey"|-0.0258325934410095|" In the second row."
"Audrey"|"Chloé"|-0.612575769424438|" WHAT?!"
"Chloé"|"Nathalie"|0.258771419525146|" My mother always sits in the front row."
"Nathalie"|"Audrey"|-0.594950318336487|" Not today."
"Audrey"|"Nathalie"|-0.799256950616837|" This is unacceptable! Gabriel cannot do this to me! I'm the one who discovered him! Without me, he'd still be drawing his unworthy designs in his dismal, grim studio!"
"Nathalie"|"Audrey"|0.00491440296173096|" I can offer your seat to someone else if you don't want it."
"Audrey"|"Nathalie"|-0.782476291060448|" How dare you? You're fired."
"Nathalie"|"Audrey"|-0.675571769475937|" I don't work for you, I work for Mr. Agreste."
"Audrey"|"Gabriel"|0.620789408683777|" We'll see about that! "
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel's voicemail"|-0.534356623888016|" I'm sorry, it took some time, I know. But today, I can feel my prey has more malice in her than anyone I've ever akumatized before. She will be my masterpiece."
"Gabriel's voicemail"|"Nathalie"|-0.529684901237488|" Please leave a message."
"Nathalie"|"Audrey"|-0.702101171016693|" I assume from your expression that I'm not fired."
"Audrey"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.701863139867783|" This is unacceptable! I will not view a fashion show from the second row, ever!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Chloé"|0.173346400260925|" Tell me, my dear akumas, what will be the trend tonight?Fly away, my little Akuma, and evillize this wonderfully vile queen!"
"Chloé"|"André"|-0.416328847408295|" Mom?"
"André"|"Hawk Moth"|0.264601588249207|" Audrey, dear?"
"Hawk Moth"|"Audrey"|-0.465972304344177|"Style Queen, I am Hawk Moth. You've been refused a throne that is rightfully yours as queen of fashion. You will now be able to revenge those fashion disasters, who disrespected you!"
"Audrey"|"Alya"|0.117258906364441|" They'll see who's queen, Hawk Moth. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.583368062973022|" All cool, girl?"
"Marinette"|"Style Queen"|-0.0496507883071899|" Mm-hm. "
"Style Queen"|"Tom"|-0.675596117973328|" A fashion show without the queen of style? Glitterally unacceptable!"
"Tom"|"Style Queen"|-0.270406365394592|" Is this supposed to happen? I've never attended a fashion show before."
"Style Queen"|"Adrien"|-0.651439785957336|" Where is that ungrateful Gabriel Agreste? I demand that he kneels before me!"
"Adrien"|"Style Queen"|-0.705633163452148|" My father isn't here!"
"Style Queen"|"Marinette"|-0.606039881706238|" Well, then, if fashion-disaster daddy isn't here, I'll just have to settle for Agreste Junior! You're fired!"
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.388314068317413|" Adrien!"
"Plagg"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.728033423423767|"Uh-oh! We've got a problem! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Tom"|-0.507418036460876|"Adrien! We no longer have a choice. Style Queen, you must defeat Ladybug and Cat Noir as soon as possible."
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.348571240901947|" But where is Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.300775825977325|"This Style Queen just made a huge faux pas!"
"Marinette"|"Style Queen"|-0.499254763126373|" Tikki, spots on! Ah!"
"Style Queen"|"André"|-0.756539940834045|" You're all fired! "
"André"|"Style Queen"|-0.553968727588654|" Audrey, dear!Darling, sweetheart, please stop this madness."
"Style Queen"|"Chloé"|-0.610353142023087|" Hmm...Fired!"
"Chloé"|"Style Queen"|-0.416328847408295|" Mom!"
"Style Queen"|"Chloé"|-0.546883702278137|" Claudine— Uh, Chloé, I'm not Mom. I am Style Queen! Do you want to be fired, too?"
"Chloé"|"Style Queen"|-0.221929013729095|" No, no, I really don't, Style Queen! Uh... besides, don't you need an assistant?"
"Style Queen"|"Chloé"|-0.571059077978134|" Hmm... I did fire my last one this morning."
"Chloé"|"Style Queen"|-0.704531937837601|" She sure was useless! Utterly useless!"
"Style Queen"|"Ladybug"|0.577259063720703|" Fine, I'll take you on trial!"
"Ladybug"|"Style Queen"|0.61571216583252|"Style Queen!"
"Style Queen"|"Ladybug"|-0.785743311047554|"What an atrocious suit! That bug looks so last year!"
"Ladybug"|"Style Queen"|0.0370852947235107|" But the yo-yo makes a strong comeback this year!"
"Style Queen"|"Chloé"|-0.760771304368973|" You're a couple of sizes too small to beat me, Ladybug."
"Chloé"|"Style Queen"|-0.0865943431854248|" Mom- uh, Style Queen! If you want to find Gabriel Agreste, I know where he lives. You can take care of Ladybug later! She's worthless anyway."
"Style Queen"|"Style Queen"|-0.679643660783768|" Hmm... It's not a completely idiotic idea."
"Style Queen"|"Chloé"|-0.481391251087189|" Courtney- uh, Chloé! Where is Gabriel Agreste?"
"Chloé"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.498477280139923|" He usually never leaves his house!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Style Queen"|0.225909352302551|"Style Queen, he's hidden safely somewhere. Ladybug is protecting him."
"Style Queen"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.582549482584|" Pff! She can barely protect herself!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Style Queen"|0.0129897594451904|" You must seize Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous! If they can't save his son, then Gabriel Agreste will have to show up."
"Style Queen"|"Chloé"|-0.127844333648682|" Don't worry, Hawk Moth, you'll get your costume jewels."
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.641629308462143|" Not again! Ooh!"
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.640852242708206|"Can't she stand still for two seconds? "
"Chloé"|"Style Queen"|-0.516039133071899|"Please, Mom, stop!"
"Style Queen"|"Chloé"|0.777798891067505|" Keep this for me, sleeping beauty."
"Chloé"|"Style Queen"|-0.598853677511215|" Oh! You're not going to hurt my Adrikens, are you, Mom?"
"Style Queen"|"Chloé"|-0.560151398181915|" Hmm! "
"Chloé"|"Style Queen"|0.345672965049744|" ...Uh, Style Queen?"
"Style Queen"|"Chloé"|-0.269835948944092|" You wanna join Agreste Junior, Kylie- Uh, Chloé?Just ask, and I'll fire you!"
"Chloé"|"Style Queen"|-0.658780336380005|" No thanks, I'm good. You're right, we don't care about him."
"Style Queen"|"Chloé"|0.554453134536743|" Make yourself useful, assistant. Tell me if you see Ladybug and Cat Noir!"
"Chloé"|"Style Queen"|0.241307973861694|" Yes, Style Queen!Oh, what am I gonna do, what am I gonna do?"
"Style Queen"|"Chloé"|-0.725131034851074|"Gabriel Agreste, if you refuse to show your face, your son will soon be nothing but glitter in the wind!"
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.682447373867035|" Oh, it doesn't break. Adrikins, wake up!"
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.310955703258514|"Cat Noir, I don't know what you're doing, but there's a witch of a villain running loose and I really need you!"
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.630498290061951|" Psst! Ladybug! Hurry up! Adrikins is crumbling!"
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.0903453230857849|" Did you see where your mother's Akuma landed?"
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.0172569751739502|" It's in the rose she put on him. Where's Cat Noir?"

"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.351442396640778|" Master Fu, Cat Noir is asking more and more questions. He's tired of being left in the dark."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.408189296722412|" Tell me, Marinette; do you put the noodles in the water before the water boils?"
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.544309586286545|" Uh, no."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.603997230529785|" Exactly. That's because there's a right time for everything. "
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.388035714626312|" Uh, what are you cooking exactly?"
"Master Fu"|"Adrien"|0.582973122596741|" When fed with a specific blend of ingredients, the kwamis can grant special power. Each power's specific mix is listed here, encoded in the Grimoire. I've deciphered most of the ingredients; for example, to trigger aquatic powers you need a branch from the dragon king's garden — that's seaweed; then secret kept in a shell — that's an oyster pearl. But the last one still puzzles me: a tear of joy. I can't figure it out, and it's required for almost every blend. Oh! Maybe it could be some dancing ant honeydew.I think I may have finally got the right mix."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.246430218219757|"Hey, Cat Noir, do you trust me?Sure, Ladybug; do you trust me, too?Are you kidding? I will never trust you! Ha ha ha ha!You must know what Ladybug's hiding from me, Plagg."

"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.432283997535706|" Did you know about the Fourme de Montbrison? Apparently, it's the oldest cheese in the world."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.726567894220352|"You don't say...!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.282726526260376|" Yes... and do you know why its rind is orange? Because they age it on special boards of spruce wood."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.702556133270264|"There's only one thing in this world that smells as good as cheese!"
"Adrien"|"Wayzz"|0.557374715805054|" Which one do you prefer, the Tomme de Bouche, or the Saintignon? "
"Wayzz"|"Master Fu"|0.393598675727844|" Mmmm, there's a slight flavor to it. Yes, I remember it being a lot like this."
"Master Fu"|"Wayzz"|0.374213337898254|" Ha! I knew it."
"Wayzz"|"Master Fu"|-0.341797053813934|" A little more salt, maybe?"

"Hawk Moth"|"Bubbler"|0.560219287872314|"Get the Miraculouses. I want those powers, NOW!"

"Bubbler"|"Ladybug"|-0.757691964507103|" Total party poopers, just like adults."
"Ladybug"|"Bubbler"|0.556590676307678|" Kids need adults."
"Bubbler"|"Ladybug"|-0.70249155163765|" False! Kids need freedom, fun, let loose and live it up. Adults are controlling and bossy."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.380611658096313|" But adults keep children safe and protected. They care for their kids, they love them!"
"Cat Noir"|"Bubbler"|-0.0129258632659912|"Most adults do anyhow. You must bring the adults back!"
"Bubbler"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.617774367332458|" Nope, never. Know what, since you care so much about these adults, why don't you go float with them for a while? "
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|-0.588583588600159|"What do you think you're doing Bubbler?! You're supposed to seize their Miraculouses!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.17245227098465|" Use your Cataclysm!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.297835469245911|" Couldn't you have said that five hundred feet ago?"

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.693686246871948|" No, thanks!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0586010813713074|" Your stick, there! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.471351742744446|" Got it! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.31100857257843|" Hang on! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.558881491422653|" Good thing cats aren't afraid of heights."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.208114266395569|" We've got to get to his bubble sword, that's got to be where the akuma is. "
"Cat Noir"|"Bubbler"|0.437108755111694|" Better hurry."
"Bubbler"|"Ladybug"|0.412660956382751|" Where is everybody? Get out here and party!"
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.705654829740524|" Sorry to burst your bubble."

"Bubbler"|"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|-0.700123161077499|" What's wrong with all you guys!? Why you gotta be such haters!? "
"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|"Bubbler"|-0.628351271152496|" NOOO!"
"Bubbler"|"Cat Noir"|-0.373418569564819|" Outer space is the next stop for your precious peeps, and they're never coming back!"

"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.705528020858765|"Nathalie? Did my son like his gift?"
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.26729291677475|" Actually, I was going to check right away sir."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.569373607635498|" Good. "
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|0.656529903411865|"A birthday present, from your father."
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.665822625160217|" Thank you. I mean, please say thank you to my father for me. "
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.582795292139053|"What do you mean not for a week?!"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|-0.495230138301849|"There were no adults yesterday to deliver it."
"Chloé"|"Alya"|-0.588329017162323|" So what? Ridiculous, utterly ridiculous! "
"Alya"|"Adrien"|0.261253952980042|"Ha ha! Serves Chloé right."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.402870655059814|" Hey girls! "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.577607393264771|"Hey, that's my scarf! He's wearing my scarf."
"Adrien"|"Alya"|0.115031003952026|"Hey, dude."
"Alya"|"Adrien"|0.518113851547241|" Yo, nice scarf, Adrien. Off the chain."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|0.658700108528137|" Yeah, can you believe my dad got this for me?He's so awesome. He's been giving me the same lame pen for three years in a row."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.0311771631240845|" Wow, I guess anyone can change. Adults can be cool when you least expect it."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.48104602098465|" Speaking of adults, I know my father said you were a bad influence, but"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.0882893204689026|" We're good, Adrien, don't sweat it. We're buds. Always and forever."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.00932502746582031|"You gotta tell him you were the one who knitted the scarf."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.0777231454849243|" But he seems so happy about his dad. I don't want to spoil it for him."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.670130014419556|" Aw, Marinette.You're amazing, girl. You know that, right? And someday Adrien will figure it out too. Promise. "
"Wayzz"|"Master Fu"|0.255046129226685|" Master, are you okay?"
"Master Fu"|"Master Fu"|0.672233700752258|" She's here!"
"Master Fu"|"Tikki"|0.280109167098999|" Hello, Ladybug!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.130067467689514|" I know you never wanted me to bring her here again but... you must see what she's discovered. Show him, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.0875626802444458|" I've been here; I've met you before. You're the healer that cured Tikki when she was sick!Soo... I'm guessing you're not really a vet?"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.0550919771194458|" Not really. That was your first day of school, that wasn't a chance meeting either.Marinette, you're always ready to help others. I knew that day, that very moment, that you'd make a fantastic Ladybug!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.182983458042145|" But, who are you?"
"Tikki"|"Wayzz"|0.591179132461548|" Master Fu is the last known member of the Order of the Guardians!"
"Wayzz"|"Marinette"|0.713796019554138|"Guardians of the Miraculous! I'm Wayzz, Master Fu's kwami. It's a pleasure to meet you, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.0180242657661438|" Uhh, you too! "
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.488948702812195|" We guardians are responsible for protecting and distributing the Miraculous, for the good of all humanity. We are chosen in childhood and trained for many years, specially for this mission. When we were much, much younger, we...I made a mistake. The guardians' temple was destroyed, all because of me! Two of the Miraculous were lost that day. The Butterfly and the Peacock. Also gone forever was the ancient spellbook!"
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.59270653128624|" But all it has are drawings of old superheroes and a bunch of strange symbols."
"Master Fu"|"Master Fu"|0.149345397949219|" Not strange to a Guardian. Back in the days, I was never given the opportunity to even have a look at it, but I've been taught enough to be able to partially decipher the code."
"Master Fu"|"Gabriel"|0.693612813949585|" These pages contain various spells capable of giving Ladybug and Cat Noir special abilities we haven't known about, until now! Obviously, this book is invaluable."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.0258258581161499|" Why did you take the book?"
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.643514096736908|" I... I just wanted to know what you were hiding behind that portrait that was so important. You.. you never told me about those things. I was intending to give it back to you, I swear! But then... I lost it."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.086259663105011|" How can I possibly trust you again, Adrien?"
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.602801591157913|" Sorry... I'll get you another copy."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|0.822812914848328|" It's one of a kind! The book's the source of my inspiration."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.575431555509567|" I didn't know that. I hardly know anything about you, Father."
"Gabriel"|"Master Fu"|-0.561820596456528|" You won't be returning to school. You'll be home-schooled again...with Nathalie."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.508902549743652|" I've always believed that whoever possessed this spellbook must also have the Peacock and the Butterfly Miraculous."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.416402757167816|" Wait a sec, you mean whoever owned the spellbook could be Hawk Moth?"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.699701070785522|" How did you discover this book, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.400110721588135|"I... uh... I found it, lying on a bench in a park close to... close to the school."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.402416110038757|" You didn't see who it belonged to, then?"
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.561079472303391|" No. No, I...didn't."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.690922975540161|" What a shame. For a moment, I thought we were about to discover the identity of Hawk Moth. We would've had a chance to defeat him."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.389026761054993|" Uh... I could investigate if you want."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.44761049747467|" But you must be very careful, Marinette. If you succeed, you may well find yourself face to face with Hawk Moth."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.271470248699188|" I'll be very careful, I promise."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.600376486778259|"Why did you lie to Master Fu?!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.146817564964294|" I couldn't tell him that Adrien was the one who had the book. Adrien can't be Hawk Moth!But what if he is?Th-That would mean that I'm crazy in love with a supervillain! I can't be crazy in love with a supervillain... I... I'd have to fight him and..."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.697511851787567|" Calm down Marinette, I'm sure there's an explanation."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.0793368220329285|" I need to get to the bottom of this."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.52262282371521|" Do you know where to find Adrien?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.412646174430847|" I know that boy's schedule by heart."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.622238278388977|" Let's go."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.640966355800629|" I don't see him. Something's up. Adrien never misses his fencing lessons."
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.710821598768234|" Oh no! "
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.748412907123566|" This is a terrible tragedy! "
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.735497564077377|" What's up with her?"
"Chloé"|"Kim"|-0.656042546033859|" Adrien's never coming back to school! Ever! Oh.. "
"Kim"|"Max"|-0.782872408628464|" His dad grounded him!"
"Max"|"Marinette"|0.369823813438416|" For life."
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.51386970281601|" What? Why?"
"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.491437554359436|" Something about losing this major important book that belongs to his dad."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.544566094875336|" His dad? Ha! Phew!"

"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.739739209413528|"\"Phew\". Cause I... I was scared it was super serious. I mean, yeah, sure, it really is serious but it's not like he's sick or anything, you know. Surely we can fix this, right? We won't just stand by and let this happen! Ha! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.702523350715637|" So it wasn't Adrien's book. It was his father's! Adrien isn't Hawk Moth!I knew it! Adrien doesn't have an evil bone in his body."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.527306616306305|" Except, according to Nino, Adrien did take the book without his father's permission."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.667644858360291|" Well, he must've had a good reason to do it."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.0107684135437012|" You realize, based on Master Fu's theory, Adrien's father could be Hawk Moth."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.39135879278183|" No way! It couldn't be! Hmm... An eccentric artist who never leaves his home. Mysterious, very intelligent, but cold, even with his own son. This is a very strong lead, Tikki!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.343996107578278|" Please be careful, Marinette!"
"Marinette"|" Marinette"|0.107585191726685|" I will."

"Gabriel"|"Plagg"|0.233461141586304|" You know where this goes. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.729497522115707|" Look on the bright side. Your father could've found out about me! It's a good thing we kwamis can never be filmed or photographed. Ah, those photographers have no idea what they're missing!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.130257308483124|" I've gotta find that book, or I'll never be allowed to return to school."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.426176071166992|" Return to school?! Are you crazy?! No more homework, no more alarm clocks! We should be celebrating! Hey, I know!I named this piece El Plaggo. It's been maturing for nine hundred and ninety-nine days!"
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|-0.273214101791382|" What was that?!"
"Nathalie"|"Nathalie"|-0.474294781684875|" Your father is very busy."
"Nathalie"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.126307904720306|" Shouldn't Adrien be practicing his piano right now?"
"Hawk Moth"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.323985278606415|" I feel...the wrath of a father betrayed by his son. What perfect prey for my akuma!Stay close, my little akuma!"

"Nooroo"|"Gabriel"|-0.0575417280197144|" Uh, why is the akuma still here?"
"Gabriel"|"Nooroo"|-0.24811178445816|" I must become someone else to lead them astray."
"Nooroo"|"Gabriel"|-0.520606964826584|" I don't understand, Master."
"Gabriel"|"The Collector"|-0.734176784753799|" Nooroo, I renounce you......temporarily.Come to me, my little akuma, and evilize me!"
"The Collector"|"Adrien"|0.704910159111023|" I am now...the Collector! My book of inspiration has been taken from me, so I shall build a new one! And perhaps pick up a Miraculous or two while I'm at it! "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.724074929952621|" My father's angry because of me; he won't forgive me until I find that book."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.541479885578156|" May I remind you that you're actually grounded?"
"Adrien"|" Adrien"|-0.462576687335968|" Adrien is, but Cat Noir isn't. "

"Cat Noir"|"The Collector"|-0.329702615737915|" Wow! I guess the Spellbook will have to wait a bit longer."
"The Collector"|"Nathalie"|0.746934652328491|" Nathalie! You'll be the first of my many inspirations to come."
"Nathalie"|"The Collector"|-0.6177738904953|" Mr. Agreste?"
"The Collector"|"The Collector"|0.20273232460022|" You will call me...the Collector."

"The Collector"|"Ladybug"|0.557004570960999|" Nothing can inspire me more than imprisoning Ladybug and Cat Noir in these pages forever. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0935040712356567|"Cat Noir, what did you do?Cat Noir, did you get my messages?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.465367436408997|" Yeah, and I can't wait to know more, M'Lady-tective. So, who's the suspect?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.426704168319702|" Gabriel Agreste.You know, the fashion designer?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.384933114051819|" You got proof?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.664057910442352|"I can't tell you."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.582413822412491|" So, I'm supposed to just... accept that?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.492979407310486|" You must trust me on this. But it all makes sense. Gabriel Agreste is a secretive man and he never leaves his house. And get this.Check out his brand's logo."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.260981738567352|"A butterfly? "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.588855385780334|" You okay, Cat Noir?"
"Cat Noir"|"The Collector"|-0.0702931880950928|"It's time to get the bottom of this. "
"The Collector"|"Ladybug"|0.708114624023438|"My plan is working perfectly!"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.739061444997787|"Whoa, what happened here? Looks like somebody had a little tantrum."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.128837168216705|" Are you sure you're okay?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.427340388298035|" Yeah. Yeah, let's keep going."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.394402980804443|"He's got a son! Let's go check his room; make sure nothing's happened to him."
"Cat Noir"|"The Collector"|-0.630357593297958|" Where's Gabriel Agreste?"
"The Collector"|"The Collector"|-0.586944699287415|" There is no more Gabriel Agreste. There is only...the Collector!"
"The Collector"|"Ladybug"|-0.607330679893494|" You won't be able to escape!"
"Ladybug"|"The Collector"|-0.131323277950287|"Wait!"
"The Collector"|"Ladybug"|0.330844879150391|" Nice piece, wouldn't you agree?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.398852944374084|"The akuma's gotta be in that book!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.595587760210037|" Yeah, but if we touch it, we'll disappear!"
"Ladybug"|"The Collector"|-0.736684918403625|" A set of pedals appears) A pedal?I have no idea what to do with this. We need to stall him."
"The Collector"|"The Collector"|0.700731635093689|"Ladybug and Cat Noir, you shall be the masterpieces in my new book of inspiration."
"The Collector"|"Ladybug"|0.62689733505249|" My collection's growing!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.586760878562927|" No!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.222150027751923|" So that must mean...Gabriel Agreste can't possibly be Hawk Moth, since he's been akumatized!"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.436355412006378|" You call Agreste turning into the Collector good news?!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.73309987783432|" Gabriel Agreste's son isn't at home?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.225058853626251|" Maybe the Collector's already captured him."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.54330512881279|"You think he'd take it out on his own son?"
"Cat Noir"|"The Collector"|-0.611643075942993|" Uh..."
"The Collector"|"Ladybug"|-0.718083441257477|" You cannot escape from me. "
"Ladybug"|"The Collector"|-0.506739675998688|" What if he has no pages left in his book? "
"The Collector"|"Ladybug"|0.482710242271423|" But before I immortalize you, allow me to seize your Miraculous for Hawk Moth."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.095991849899292|" Cat Noir, I need ammunition!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.623955011367798|" You need what?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.612764954566956|" We're gonna complete his collection!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.662654280662537|" Very smart M'Lady, quite ingenious."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.550870954990387|" Less talking, more doing!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.726003736257553|" Cataclysm!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.188238143920898|" Ready, Cat Noir?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.694303393363953|" I'm always ready for you, M'Lady!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.126441597938538|" Come on! Come on!"
"Cat Noir"|"The Collector"|-0.445518493652344|" No more ammo!"
"The Collector"|"The Collector"|-0.241939067840576|" Huh? It's already full!"
"The Collector"|"Ladybug"|-0.554180175065994|" My book! No!"

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.679880112409592|" Pound...Uh. "
"Cat Noir"|"Gabriel"|-0.158363163471222|" Are you okay, Faaa...sir?"
"Gabriel"|"Cat Noir"|-0.704583495855331|" Cat Noir, Ladybug, what happened to me?"
"Cat Noir"|"Gabriel"|-0.748981803655624|" You were akumatized by Hawk Moth. But don't worry, it's over now!"
"Gabriel"|"Cat Noir"|0.696247816085815|" Thank you, thank you, both of you!Adrien...where is my son?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.775231391191483|" He...must be hiding?"
"Ladybug"|"Gabriel"|-0.656187891960144|" Cat Noir is right, otherwise your son would have reappeared right here."
"Gabriel"|"Ladybug"|-0.620446711778641|" Nothing must happen to him. He's too precious to me. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.308811128139496|"We're about to transform back. Goodbye, Mr. Agreste."
"Cat Noir"|"Gabriel"|-0.297666966915131|" Don't worry yourself, sir. I'm sure your son is safe and sound. "
"Gabriel"|"Marinette"|0.587366938591003|" See you very soon!"
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.0489512085914612|" So, since Gabriel Agreste was akumatized, he can't possibly be Hawk Moth, right? "
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.43312668800354|" That's very probable, but...how did you find out that Gabriel Agreste was the owner of the Spellbook?"
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.251871705055237|" At first, I was thinking the book belonged to Gabriel Agreste's son, Adrien, 'cause I saw him with it at school — well before it was stolen by a girl and before Tikki got it back; and I'd only just met you so I...I didn't know if I could tell you that, so yeah."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.563769578933716|" You were afraid in case the one you love turned out to be Hawk Moth."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.220709264278412|"Wha... Uh, no, uh, how did you know that? I mean, I don't love him at all.Oh, all right, yes, Adrien is amazing. I couldn't stand the thought of him being a supervillain. "
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.346197009086609|" You know, Marinette, if we want to be stronger than Hawk Moth, we have to trust each other."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|-0.644103586673737|" I know; but now, Adrien will never be able to come back to school because I can never give him that book back. I'll never ever see him again! "
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|-0.484751403331757|" There isn't a single problem that can't be solved, Marinette.These modern inventions really are quite incredible. Hmm."
"Marinette"|"Gabriel"|-0.661101311445236|" So, when Adrien put the book down and walked away, I wanted to take a peek. You see, I thought it was a portfolio with lots of pictures of him 'cause he's so cute. Uh, but you already knew that.Anyway, um, when he came back, I was scared he'd see me staring at his book so I hid it in my backpack and I know it was a dumb thing to do. I'm really, really sorry."
"Gabriel"|"Marinette"|0.513293027877808|" I see. So, you're one of his admirers?"
"Marinette"|"Gabriel"|-0.149665832519531|" Admirers? Yeah. That's the word.You won't say anything to him, will you?Are you going to let Adrien come back to school?"
"Gabriel"|"Marinette"|-0.6985964179039|" Well, considering he didn't actually lose my book as it was borrowed by you, yes I will."
"Marinette"|"Gabriel"|0.556468963623047|"Thank you.Hmm, can I ask you a question?I flipped through the book and it looked really awesome. Those illustrations of legendary heroes are super...inspiring. Where did you get it?"
"Gabriel"|"Marinette"|0.58167040348053|" I found it while I was on a trip overseas with my wife. I've never seen another copy of it."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.33482301235199|" Well then, you're very lucky to own it. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.509245753288269|" It was really brave what you just did for Adrien."
"Marinette"|"Gabriel"|-0.18578690290451|" Thanks, Tikki. All that really matters is for Adrien to be allowed out of the house again. "
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.783254817128181|" I'm sorry I became so furious over a book."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|-0.647649854421616|" I shouldn't have taken it without your permission."
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.317113876342773|" That book...was the very last gift your mother gave to me before...before she disappeared. All I have left of her is this book...and you. But I know I can't keep the book or you locked up in this house forever."
"Adrien"|"Gabriel"|0.128122091293335|" Does that mean you'll let me go back to school, then?"
"Gabriel"|"Adrien"|-0.413255751132965|" Hm. "
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|0.715640306472778|" Thank you, Father! "
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|-0.560269147157669|" So then, if you already had a copy of the book, why'd you go through all that trouble?"
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|-0.175156891345978|" I did what had to do to keep my secret."
"Gabriel"|"Nooroo"|0.781732320785522|" Happy to see me again?"
"Nooroo"|"Gabriel"|0.540053129196167|" At your service, Master."
"Gabriel"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.0202228426933289|" Nooroo, dark wings rise!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Wayzz"|0.663690328598022|" Ladybug, Cat Noir — you almost managed to find out who I am; but now I am more above suspicion than I've ever been. As of today, nothing will prevent me from getting your Miraculous, and making my greatest wish come true! All I need to do now is wait for my next prey. "
"Marinette"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.52979850769043|"Sleepover at your place tonight? That'd be awesome!"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Marinette"|0.00388216972351074|" Come on! Hurry up! I don't have all day!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.612582504749298|" Except ugh, I can't. I-I have to help my parents at the bakery."
"Alya"|"Adrien"|-0.066892147064209|" Again? But you've been helping them out all week."

"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.530498176813126|" I forgot I got Chinese class."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.668567597866058|" Again? But we haven't played all week."
"Adrien"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.633417665958405|" I'm sorry, Nino."

"Mr. Damocles"|"Mrs. Michelle"|-0.140644073486328|" Hoo-hoo! Well, Mrs. Michelle. Has Whiskers got vertigo again? Have no fear! This is the mission for The Owl! Hoo-hoo!Owl Talons!Hoo-merang! "
"Mrs. Michelle"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.556615620851517|" Um? What exactly are you planning with that?"
"Mr. Damocles"|"Mrs. Michelle"|0.0353803634643555|" It-it-it takes more than this to persuade The Owl!Here, kitty, kitty! Come to Owl! "
"Mrs. Michelle"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.0913744568824768|" Okay, I'll call the fire department. "
"Mr. Damocles"|"Ladybug"|-0.285678803920746|" No need for that, Mrs. Michelle.Uh-oh! Whiskers! Stay calm! Come on now!Ow!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.524601697921753|"Mr. Dam...um, Owl! This is the fifth time this week we come to your rescue!"
"Cat Noir"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.713710993528366|" You're really going to get hurt one of these days.At least wear a helmet."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Ladybug"|-0.657772213220596|" But you don't wear helmets."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.17610889673233|" Mr. Owl, we've told you already. It's not the same for us. We're real superheroes!"
"Cat Noir"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.54506778717041|" With real superpowers!And magic suits."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Firefighter"|-0.13191694021225|" I know. But since I was a little boy, I only ever dreamed of becoming a real superhero!"
"Firefighter"|"Nadja"|0.0423929691314697|" Come on, boys!"
"Nadja"|"Clara Contard"|0.632878065109253|" The exploits of Ladybug and Cat Noir have inspired some people to act as superheroes themselves. But is it a good thing? Over to our reporter Clara Contard."
"Clara Contard"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.608701109886169|" Today Ladybug and Cat Noir had once again come to the aid of the self-proclaimed new superhero The Owl."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Clara Contard"|0.550606727600098|"Thanks to some advice from my good friends Ladybug and Cat Noir, I am certain I will do better next time!I will be reviewing my weaponry and engaging in training. Because wherever there's injustice, there's The Owl!Owl Mist!Hoo-hoo!Hoo-hoo!Sorry!"
"Clara Contard"|"Ladybug"|0.392353177070618|" Any comments, Ladybug and Cat Noir?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.598722815513611|" Uh, you know, he's a great guy. But to all the children of Paris, you mustn't copy him, okay? It's very dangerous!"
"Cat Noir"|"Nadja"|-0.691360533237457|" Ladybug's right. So, don't try this at home. Okay, kids? "
"Nadja"|"Cat Noir"|-0.46420031785965|" Meanwhile, the question that's remains on every Parisian's lips is: \"Who lies behind the mask of The Owl?\" The clumsiest superhero in all of Paris!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.457337498664856|" The principal Mr. Damocles has a good heart, but this is bound to end badly."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.541534274816513|" And we can't spend all our time watching out for him either.It's turning into a full time job!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.644450843334198|" Perhaps we should convince him to stop trying to be a superhero by... scaring him, for example?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.357891261577606|" And shatter the poor man's dream? No way! On the contrary, maybe we should help him make his dream come true. He said all he wanted was to be a hero, even if it's just for one day."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.0676964521408081|" Of course! If we make him a hero for a day like he always dream of, he'll be happy and quit playing this dangerous game. Spot on as usual, my Lady! We just have to figure out how?"
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|0.41655433177948|" I just may have an idea."
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|0.085832953453064|"Sabrina, oh why don't you hold onto my homework for me?"

"Chloé"|"Ms. Mendeleiev"|-0.201643347740173|" Uh, Miss, can't you add her to another group? Sabrina and I work much better on our own."
"Ms. Mendeleiev"|"Chloé"|-0.670769453048706|" This is a group presentation, not pairs! Deal with it."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.696013569831848|" I hate dealing with it!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.42257434129715|" You wouldn't be willing to trade groups, would ya?"

"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|0.0759552717208862|" It's okay, Marinette. You and I will do all the research, and the writing for our project, and then, Chloé can present it! That way it's equal."
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|-0.637259989976883|" That's not equal at all! Is that how you two work?!"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|0.532731652259827|" Yeah! We've been doing this ever since grade school, when I started doing Chloé's homework! And we've been BFF's ever since!"

"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.5172438621521|" Sabrina, Chloé's totally taking advantage of you. You don't have to do what she says. That's not how a real best friend acts!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.725268095731735|" Ugh, not only am I Sabrina's best friend, I'm her only friend, so she better do what I say, 'cause without me, she has nothing."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.619605422019958|" Well, I'd rather have no friends than be friends with you."
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.490424036979675|" Whatever. I've got more important things to worry about. My hair is a hot mess and Jean Claude promised to work his magic. Later!"
"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|0.656405687332153|" Marinette!I can't believe you stood up to Chloé like that! It was so amazing."
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|0.193963289260864|" Uhh, well...Yeah, what are friends for?"
"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|0.719096779823303|" You are my friend, and I'm really super excited to hang out with you, and have a new best friend who actually helps with the project! We're going to have the absolute best time together! Then, we'll do the presentation, and tell Ms. Mendeleiev the truth about Chloé! Sound good?"
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|-0.628031462430954|" Sounds...great?"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|0.745412707328796|" YAY! Then I'll see you in the library, bestie!"
"Chloé"|"Sabrina"|-0.717307329177856|" Ugh! What do you mean, you're not doing my assignment?!"
"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|-0.43067854642868|" Marinette's right! I...I'm not your slave!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.610363394021988|" I never actually said that..."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.298090934753418|" But Marinette didn't buy a super cute beret at Gabriel's, and I did! And perhaps I could lend it to you."
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|-0.50154635310173|" Excuse me, but are you trying to bribe her into staying your friend? With a hat?"
"Sabrina"|"Chloé"|0.6006920337677|" Uhhh... really, really adorable hat! That would look fantastic on me!"
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.165350317955017|" No, excuse from ME, but you are trying to steal my friend from me, with homework!"
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.440483033657074|" Ahh! My hair!"
"Chloé"|" Adrien"|0.137860417366028|" Ahhh! Please! Please! Ahhhh!"
" Adrien"|"Chloé"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.584740728139877|" No! Not the hair!"
"Marinette"|" Marinette"|0.164726614952087|" Time to transform!"
" Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.499254763126373|" Tikki, spots on! Ah!"
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.590879410505295|" No! Stop!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.484963357448578|" Run and hide! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.615744829177856|" I got wind that you were being blown away by a hairy situation."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.65563553571701|" Fewer puns, more action!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.584426999092102|"Well, that guy looks pretty sketchy!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.564496457576752|" Where'd he go?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.23916107416153|" I don't know, but he sure has a way of illustrating his point."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.779275208711624|"Ughhh..."
"Cat Noir"|"Chloé"|-0.467471241950989|" Seems this Evillustrator's targeting you specifically, Chloé. Any idea why?"
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.625467628240585|" No. Everyone adores me."
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|0.625516295433044|"Yeah, because you're sooo adorable."
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|0.713947296142578|" Yeesss! Ladybug just said I'm adorable! I totally need a picture of the two of us together! "
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.697121262550354|" Ugh! That was unpleasant."
"Chloé"|"Ladybug"|-0.240550994873047|" Well, I look great, of course, but your smile is all wonky. I'll take another! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.667567521333694|" Sorry, I'm just a little camera shy."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.0224204659461975|" Looks like somebody's got a fan!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.728896975517273|" Yeah, great."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.482699036598206|" So what's the deal? Why are you acting so weird? Come on, you gotta admit that having this girl worship you is pretty awesome."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.322075605392456|"Ugh, seriously? I'm over this! Let's go!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.599542319774628|" Are you kidding me? And what if the Evillustrator attacks her again?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.397986531257629|" Fine! You stay! Later!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.573841452598572|" What do you mean later?"
"Ladybug"|"Chloé"|-0.441290676593781|" I mean, you're the one who wants to protect her, but you don't need me. So, later! "
"Chloé"|"Tikki"|-0.0991827845573425|"Ahhh! Ladybug! Text me! OK!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.56628891825676|"Ow!Hey!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.737567096948624|" Sorry, Tikki... Chloé! She just...fires up this little red bug!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.736728996038437|" Well, simmer down! A hot head isn't going to get you anywhere!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.0742657780647278|" It's hard to keep my cool. Especially in school. Oh my gosh! Sabrina! The project! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.116238296031952|" Uh-oh... Looks like you got yourself a new BFF!"
"Marinette"|"Evillustrator"|0.0227576494216919|" It's you! From the library! What are you doing here?"
"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|0.492894053459167|" I just wanted to see you."
"Marinette"|"Evillustrator"|-0.720400243997574|" Okay... But why did you attack Chloé?"
"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|-0.727835595607758|" 'Cause Chloé is cruel and selfish!"
"Marinette"|"Evillustrator"|-0.554375559091568|" Can't argue with that... Are you going to hurt me?"
"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|0.421522259712219|" You? You're Marinette! You're beautiful and sweet and... you're perfect and I could never hurt you!"
"Marinette"|"Evillustrator"|0.0187206268310547|" Wow...that's, uh... very, umm...flattering! Uh, thank you?"
"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|0.696496725082397|" So, I just came by to ask you, it, uh, well, it's my birthday today, and, uh, would you wanna come to my party?"
"Marinette"|"Evillustrator"|0.141348004341125|" Oh, umm... Actually, it's not really the best night. See, I got a presentation to work on, and...I have to call my friend, so we can meet and..."
"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|0.191966891288757|" Oh please, Marinette! It'll just be you and me. "
"Marinette"|"Evillustrator"|-0.490933358669281|" Oh my gosh! That's...me!"
"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|0.627263069152832|" You like it?"
"Marinette"|"Evillustrator"|0.734202146530151|" I...love it! So much that I will absolutely be at your party. On one condition."
"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|0.308025002479553|" Anything for you, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Evillustrator"|-0.703563243150711|" You can't hurt Chloé anymore. I simply cannot bear violence."
"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|0.412400603294373|" For you and only you. Meet you on the left bank, next to Notre-Dame, at sunset! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.641958653926849|" Ahh...."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.10597562789917|" What are you thinking, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.562625885009766|" I'm thinking poor Nathaniel's got a crush on me. And his alter ego, the Evillustrator's gonna get crushed by Ladybug!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.123069524765015|" Yes, but... how exactly is Ladybug going to crush this crush when...you're going on a date with as Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.300533950328827|" Oh, maybe some cool cat needs to crash the party."
"Chloé"|"Cat Noir"|-0.16849422454834|" Ohhh... Sabrina is so selfish! Making me do this project by myself?! Ugh, my brain hurts... Huh? Hey! Cat Noir, Are you any good at particle physics?"
"Cat Noir"|"Chloé"|-0.366291701793671|" Oh, this cat's got particle physics in the bag."
"Chloé"|"Cat Noir"|0.0439225435256958|" Ah! Great!Sit, kitty!Now, make it sound purr-fect for my presentation. See what I did? I made a cat joke! Ah! I can be funny."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.606587618589401|"Yeah, hilarious.You can't just fly out of here and then decide to make cat calls, Ladybug!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.508648753166199|"I'm sorry, that wasn't cool. But you can leave Chloé. I need you to protect this girl instead. Her name is Marinette. Really cute, isn't she? The Evillustrator is in love with her, and promised not to harm Chloé as long as Marinette comes to his birthday party."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.434475481510162|" While he's distracted, I want you to take him down."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.491466522216797|" What about you?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.107744693756104|" I'm going on... a very important secret mission. I'll catch up with you later. Can you handle this alone?"
"Cat Noir"|"Chloé"|-0.321519613265991|" Ha! Please! It'll be a cinch!You're out of danger, uh, so I'll see ya! Later! "
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.415786862373352|" Later?! What about my presentation?! Ughhhh!"
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|-0.572715073823929|" Oh! Sabrina! You scared me."
"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|-0.453647613525391|" Sorry...I was just waiting for you. Did you get my messages?"
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|0.444829821586609|" Yes! Yes I did! And I was totally gonna call you."
"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|-0.112717270851135|" You were? I knew you would! Eventually. And so? I did your geography homework! "
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|-0.232328474521637|"Whoa! You didn't have to do that."
"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|0.48360538482666|" Well, since you're my new best friend, it's the least I can do."
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|-0.690606385469437|" Thanks, but I just can't."
"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|-0.319303929805756|" Really?"
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|-0.233194828033447|" Oh, okay, but just this once. "
"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|0.61507248878479|" Great! So, you wanna work on the physics project tonight?"
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|-0.546913623809814|" Uhhh, I'm so sorry Sabrina, I've got something really important that I have to do."
"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|0.143089175224304|" Something really important? Really? That's fascinating. Oh, you know who else uses that excuse all the time, don't you?"
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|-0.556665629148483|" Um, no?"
"Sabrina"|"Marinette"|0.505223870277405|" Chloé! I'm beginning to see how similar you two are! I bet you'd expect me to do all the work like she did, right?"
"Marinette"|"Sabrina"|-0.466749966144562|" No! I don't! Really! It's just that"
"Sabrina"|"Cat Noir"|-0.201355874538422|"I can't believe I did your geography homework for you..."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.416186809539795|" Whoo-hoo! I thought I was going to have to save you from that girl's claws. Get it? Claws? Hey, I haven't even introduced myself. I'm Cat Noir."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.19786411523819|" Uh, yeah... I know! You kinda save the day all the time and stuff...I'm Marinette! So... What are you doing here?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.683705717325211|" Well, that birthday boy date of yours is bad news. But don't worry. You'll be safe with me."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.406630992889404|" That puts my mind at ease."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.286696791648865|" But I am going to need a little help. Care to assist a superhero?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.311706304550171|"What about Ladybug? Aren't you a duo?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.112729907035828|" She's busy with something tonight, so...You get to be my Ladybug."
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.484897494316101|"Me and Cat Noir? Fighting crime together? Amaazing! What do I do?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.0145637989044189|" Just get that drawing pencil away from it, little lady. I'll take care of the rest. "
"Marinette"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Hawk Moth"|"Evillustrator"|-0.217618107795715|" That is a lovely little scene you're setting. But I don't want you to get distracted, boy."
"Evillustrator"|"Hawk Moth"|0.214558482170105|" But I just want Marinette to love me."
"Hawk Moth"|"Evillustrator"|0.67041289806366|" And I want the Miraculous. So get it! Or else."
"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|0.49754798412323|" Okay, I will, I will!"

"Evillustrator"|"Evillustrator"|0.648176550865173|" You like it? Well hold on, 'cause I'm just getting started."
"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|-0.778918117284775|" Grr! Come on, you've gotta be kidding!"
"Marinette"|"Evillustrator"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?"
"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|-0.739784628152847|" Uhh, sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. It's just... I can't draw properly in the dark."
"Marinette"|"Evillustrator"|-0.560151398181915|" Hmm!"
"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|0.35146176815033|"Voila!"
"Marinette"|"Evillustrator"|-0.614761054515839|"You're so talented! I just don't understand why you wanna use your power to hurt people."
"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|-0.555633157491684|" Not all people. Just Chloé. And I'm never doing that again. After all, you were true to your promise, so I'll be true to mine."
"Marinette"|"Evillustrator"|-0.352840065956116|" I...actually draw a little too, I'm not as good as you are, of course."
"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|0.481882214546204|" I'm sure you're a wonderful artist."
"Marinette"|"Evillustrator"|0.621413350105286|" Well, can I draw you something special for your birthday?"
"Evillustrator"|"Evillustrator"|0.488684773445129|" That would be amazing."

"Evillustrator"|"Marinette"|-0.737543851137161|" Marinette! You're working with him? I'm so stupid... I actually thought you liked me! But you're really just like Chloé. Teasing me, mocking me, leading me on!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.182631492614746|" Come on! Seriously? Why is everybody comparing me to Chloé tonight?"
"Marinette"|"Evillustrator"|-0.652557343244553|" Dahh!"
"Evillustrator"|"Cat Noir"|-0.248164713382721|" And I'm taking back my promise! Chloé's gonna get a little lesson she'll never forget! "

"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.805466458201408|"Boo-hoo-hoo! I'm so sorry, miss, but after what happened at the library, I simply couldn't work on my project! It would've been too...traumatic! Just look what it's done to my...my...hair!Oh, please. Who's going to believe that?! Even a stupid hairdryer couldn't make me look bad."
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.347382128238678|" Uh? Cat Noir? Is that you?"
"Chloé"|"Evillustrator"|-0.532956779003143|" Ahhhh! "
"Evillustrator"|"Chloé"|-0.474529325962067|" Chloé, where are you? Are you hiding? That is so cute. You're playing hide-and-seek. In the closet?!"

"Ladybug"|"Evillustrator"|-0.292628169059753|" If I told you, it wouldn't be a secret."
"Evillustrator"|"Chloé"|0.11903989315033|" In the comics, this is what's known as the final showdown. The thing is, if you knew her, you wouldn't be breaking a sweat to save her skin! She's the real baddie!"

"Chloé"|"Alya"|-0.706378728151321|" Well, to be perfectly honest, they only made matters worse. They came barreling in, and started smashing things to bits, throwing plastic balls around my room!"

"Chris"|"Sarah"|0.775911211967468|" Well, he's a very convincing actor."
"Sarah"|"Chris"|-0.744865328073502|" Actually, he is a great actor. But he's always making excuses for why he's late, why he's..."
"Chris"|"Sarah"|-0.734407067298889|" Falls asleep in the middle of rehearsal? Why he has to leave early? Why he's missing parts of his costume? Come on, Sarah! When are you gonna wake up and smell the coffee? But it's up to you if you wanna make the show suffer."
"Sarah"|"Chris"|0.28351092338562|" Look, you're his understudy. Just be ready to take his place in case something happens, okay?"
"Chris"|"Sarah"|-0.623616069555283|" I won't let you down, Sarah."

"Chris"|"Fred"|-0.35960841178894|" No, this is Chris. Sarah asked me to call you with a last-minute location change. The bus is picking us up in 10 minutes, in front of the Louvre Pyramid."

"Alya"|"Tikki"|0.132531046867371|" Wait! I have to show you my awesome vid... Where'd my phone go?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.7686937302351|" You stole Alya's phone?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.279530167579651|" Um, I... borrowed it! Look. All I need to do is transform into Ladybug and film myself during the exact same thing in the exact same place. And then I'll give it right back."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.662196457386017|" I don't know. Maybe it's just better to come clean now. You might be digging yourself a bigger hole."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.0590524673461914|" I can handle this."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.462136626243591|" Fine. But don't say I didn't warn you."

"Mylène"|"Marinette"|0.567375540733337|"Do you have Alya's cellphone?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.689060568809509|" Uh, Alya's phone? Ah! There it is! It must have fallen down off her bag! Silly girl."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.632586002349854|"Me! I'm here too."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.645679354667664|" Oh! Hi, Alya. You're on speakerphone? Hmm.. 'kay, I'll give it to you later on...at the show. See ya!"
"Marinette"|" Marinette"|-0.597065001726151|" Don't look at me like that. This is all gonna work out! I think..."
" Marinette"|"Chris"|-0.443314373493195|" Tikki, spots on! Ha!"
"Chris"|"Sarah"|-0.610338717699051|" We have to get to the Eiffel Tower for dress rehearsal. If you wait any longer, you'll be jeopardizing the entire production."
"Sarah"|"Chris"|0.488438129425049|"You're right, Chris. Let's get going. You'll be taking Fred's place tonight."
"Chris"|"Fred"|-0.685688614845276|" I definitely won't let you down."
"Fred"|"Chris"|0.207291007041931|" Where are they?Excuse me, you haven't seen a bus with the poster for The Mime's Extraordinary Adventures on it, have you? "
"Chris"|"Fred"|-0.70220273733139|" He's got some nerve. Calling now? I wouldn't give him the time of day if I were you."
"Fred"|"Sarah"|0.0067751407623291|"Sarah, where are you?"
"Sarah"|"Fred"|-0.389367163181305|" We waited for you, but you never came."
"Fred"|"Sarah"|-0.416949987411499|" But I'm on time! In front of the pyramid."
"Sarah"|"Fred"|-0.495974481105804|" What are you talking about? Why would we be meeting there?"
"Fred"|"Sarah"|-0.675680696964264|" I don't know! I...I thought the meeting place had changed!"
"Sarah"|"Fred"|-0.748023241758347|" Fred, I don't want to hear any of your lame excuses."
"Fred"|"Sarah"|-0.251354038715363|" But, Chris said..."
"Sarah"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.289509177207947|" I don't care. It's not just this excuse, it's...every excuse. It's always an excuse. Well, enough is enough. Chris will be the lead tonight at the premiere. At least I can count on him."
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|-0.219248116016388|"Hmm. An actor who misses his own premiere. Now that's a tragedy.Go, my evil akuma, let's hand this actor the role of a lifetime!"
"Ladybug"|"Fred"|-0.649376720190048|" Okie dokie, here we go... Hey, aren't you Alya, the girl who writes the blog about me? The... LadyblHey! No, get away!Ugh...that is so... Eww!Cats are nothing but trouble."
"Fred"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.756548672914505|" What did I do? You're going to be so disappointed at me, Mylène..."
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|0.306010603904724|" Mime, I am Hawk Moth. I'm giving you the power to make whatever you gesture come to life. Destroy this premiere performance! You may be a mime, but they can't silence you! However, in return, you must bring me back Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculouses. So, shall we get on with the show?"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.632731944322586|" Are you okay?It looks like Mylène's dad's hat. Oh no! Mr. Haprèle? If there's something ticking you off, we can talk about it, you know?"
"Ladybug"|"Nathalie"|-0.607152014970779|" Or maybe not. "
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|0.476484656333923|" Yes, sir. Understood, sir. I'm, sure he'll understand, sir."
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|-0.748919874429703|" My dad's flaking, isn't he? Let me guess. Something came up?"
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|0.000217437744140625|" Yes, but he has reserved the best seats in the house for you, Adrien. Front row."
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.689454197883606|" As usual. The best money can buy."
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.30868673324585|" Get out of the car and find a place to hide, I'll cover you."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.278674244880676|" We gotta transform now, Plagg."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.442011415958405|" I thought I was gonna be a spectator, not a performer. What about the show?"
"Adrien"|" Adrien"|-0.643738895654678|" No time."
" Adrien"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Cat Noir"|0.534212589263916|" Grab her Miraculous, the earrings! Now!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.432748913764954|" Keep those hands to yourself, clown! It's okay, I've got this."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.652244210243225|" My pleasure, Cat Noir..."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.630471676588058|" Apparently, not seeing is believing."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.693093776702881|" We can't let him go like that!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.38881927728653|" No, wait, don't!"

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.729944199323654|" Nice ride, but if I were you, I would have at least made it a convertible."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.299973607063293|" He's one of the actors from the theater troupe, and he's after that bus!Where is he going? We gotta stop this thing!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.285641968250275|" Slam down on the brake!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.396982729434967|" What brake? "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.645606398582458|" Not bad, for driving an invisible car, Course, they'll never believe us if we tell them we just saved their lives."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.265051007270813|" He's already off again! We gotta catch up with the bus before he does!What do you think you're doing?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.169508099555969|" Good thing you have friends in high places. Hold on! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.33056640625|" I could have done this on my own."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.0742172598838806|"' But we're the cat-and-bug team, remember?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.441912353038788|" Bug-and-cat team, you mean. Now drop me off over there."

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.185517072677612|" Inside his hat!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.147025465965271|" How'd you know that?"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.724206924438477|" I have hidden talents. Trust me on this one."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.519384682178497|" You better distract him."

"Sarah"|"Ladybug"|-0.244753301143646|" Ladybug, what's happening?"
"Ladybug"|"Sarah"|-0.42375910282135|" One of your actors has been akumatized, and for some reason, he's seemed to heading in for your troupe!"
"Sarah"|"Ladybug"|-0.530980706214905|" Fred?"
"Ladybug"|"Chris"|-0.18243020772934|" Stay inside and don't panic. We'll get this under control."

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.192141890525818|" Yes! Remember, he can only mime one thing at a time."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.329498171806335|" So he's cornered. Good thinking, my lady.Yoink!"
"Ladybug"|"Fred"|-0.320563852787018|" No more evildoing for you, little akuma. Time to de-evilize!Gotcha!Bye bye little butterfly. Miraculous Ladybug!"
"Fred"|"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|-0.148170530796051|" What happened? How did I... get here?"
"Ladybug and Cat Noir"|"Sarah"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it!"
"Sarah"|"Chris"|-0.690422534942627|" I'm so sorry I didn't believe you, Fred."
"Chris"|"Cat Noir"|-0.691954344511032|" I'm sorry too. I was so desperate to perform that I lied to you about where we were meeting up."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.582962572574615|" Your earrings!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.579287171363831|" Better get going."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.521335542201996|" Such a shame. I could have been your date in the play tonight. Just you and me."
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.358404994010925|" Thanks, but I have other plans."
"Hawk Moth"|"Marinette"|-0.206758618354797|" The show's not over yet, Ladybug. You just wait. There's still a last act to come when you least expect it. "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.471351742744446|" Got it!"
"Adrien"|"Alya"|0.0542541742324829|"Ah, hey, you're here too, cool. Thought I was gonna end up sitting by myself."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.455181956291199|" Hey, did you bring my phone? "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.494014978408813|" I don't know which I loved more. The show or sitting next to my sweet Adrien!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.502381682395935|" Maybe you should give him a call and ask him out to a movie."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.518064051866531|" Speaking of calling, there's something I gotta tell you, Alya. I...accidentally erased your Ladybug video on your phone, and then, when I tried to fix the problem I dropped the phone in a dumpster and now it stinks like bad, like really, really bad, and I'm sorry, so, so, so sorry. I know how much that video meant to you and I'm the lamest of friends. Lamer than lame!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.473972082138062|"Chillax, lady. If there's anyone on this earth who knows about your legendary clumsiness, it's me, your BFF!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.643286228179932|" So... You're not angry?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.448301792144775|" Well, you should've just come clean and told me in the first place. But no, we're cool. Besides, I uploaded the video on to my Ladyblog before I showed it to you."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.124504446983337|"I'm so lucky to have a friend like you! Now that we're good, you probably don't care about the surprise I planned for you."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.0630897283554077|"Screw up or no screw-up, you know I love surprises!"
"Marinette"|"Ladybug"|0.362526655197144|" Okay, you see that theater over there? There's something inside for you, on the stage."
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.392353177070618|" Hello! Alya, right?Last time I saw you, I was in a hurry, but I've got a bit more time now if you want to interview me for your Ladyblog."
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.302895307540894|"No... Seriously? Do I? Do I?! "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.218649983406067|" Have a seat."
"Alya"|"Tikki"|0.651080369949341|" You don't know me, but FYI, this is like the biggest moment of my life! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.764676332473755|" Alya's lucky to have you as a friend too, you know!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.537619739770889|" Well?Show me!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.598629653453827|" Only after I put it on my blog! There's no way I'm gonna lose this video!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.313398241996765|" Hey! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.0443466901779175|" Don't blink now, 'cause we are live from Paris. Yo peeps, Alya here, bringing you the one and only Ladyblog.Huh? What is that? . Ladybug in action. Hang on 'cause we're going for a ride.Freak out! What you got here is no ordinary book, it's a tenth grade history book. And I should know, 'cause I've got this very same book. Could our very own Ladybug be a high school student,in real life? Whoa! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.457193493843079|" I told you from day one Tikki, I'm a total klutz! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.0487879514694214|" What's done is done; we can't change what happened. We can only move forward. Alya must not find out who you are. You know how persistent she can be with her blog totally dedicated to Ladybug. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.691342532634735|" But how? Maybe I'm not cut out for this whole Ladybug thing. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.475204348564148|" You are the chosen one, Marinette. It will all work out, trust me. Everyone has a past they can learn from.This will show you why. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.208819508552551|" An exhibition at the Louvre? On the pharaoh Tutankhamun? What does that have to do with my book and Alya? "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.412568330764771|" You must persuade Alya to go there with you, and make sure she brings the book. You'll tell her you found out something about Ladybug. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.024144172668457|" At the museum? "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.225159466266632|" You'll see! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.106201827526093|" Well, I don't know how I'm gonna convince Alya to go to an Egyptian exhibit, much less convince her that I'm not Ladybug! "
"Tikki"|"Alya"|0.558217883110046|" She will be interested, and so will you. Promise . "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.674732327461243|" Can you believe it? All I gotta do is find to do who this history book belongs to and BAM, I figure out Ladybug's true identity! I'm so on this one! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.0198296308517456|" You really think you could figure out who Ladybug is from a textbook that every high school student owns? "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.477211058139801|" Yep. 'Cause our school is the only school that uses that book! HA! So, all I gotta do is find out which girl in tenth grade lost her history book last week. There are forty-three girls, not counting myself "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.71352145075798|" Forty-two! Not count you... or me. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.673444330692291|"Hmm, yesterday somebody didn't have their textbook in class. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.616888642311096|"Uh I left it at home. You know how I always forget my stuff. "
"Alya"|"Jalil"|-0.627207934856415|" Hmm...Just messing with you, Marinette. Of course I'll only drop you from my investigation when you bring your history book back to class. "
"Jalil"|"Alya"|-0.674598515033722|" It's not broken! "
"Alya"|"Jalil"|0.160630822181702|"Uh, I'm okay too, thanks for asking. "
"Jalil"|"Alya"|0.34515380859375|" I'm sorry. Hey, you're in the same grade as Alix, right? I'm her older brother, Jalil Kubdel. So you're into Tutankhamun too?Dad! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.109891057014465|" Weird. So again girl, why are we here? This exhibit's got something to do with Ladybug? For reals? "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.251311004161835|" Well, uh...Yeah, it's over there."
"Alya"|"Adrien"|-0.0787605047225952|" Hang on, 'cause we're going for a ride. Freak out! What you got here is no ordinary book, it's a tenth grade history book. And I should know, 'cause I've got this very same book. Could our very own Ladybug be a high school student, in real life? "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.445839047431946|" That's crazy! What are the odds that we have the same textbook? Maybe we even go to the same school! "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.402928650379181|" Don't you think you know her then?Why bother yourself with ladies when you could be enjoying this? "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.617177248001099|" For one, ladies smell about a thousand times better than that cheese. And they're much better-looking. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.721069544553757|" Suit yourself. Your loss. "
"Adrien"|"Alya"|-0.770010694861412|" My only loss is my appetite."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.407789349555969|" Come on, tell me what it is already! "
"Marinette"|"Jalil"|-0.590781569480896|" No, no, cause... it wouldn't be a surprise then...for you or me. "
"Jalil"|"Mr. Kubdel"|-0.0601181387901306|" I'm telling you, father, it's right there in the hieroglyphics.Excuse me. There, as you know, the one with the scepter is Tutankhamun, the first. And there, opposite is Nefertiti, his princess. There are exactly one hundred mummies beside them. She died several years before him, and the sun god Ra took her as his goddess. "
"Mr. Kubdel"|"Jalil"|0.57087516784668|" Yes, I know all that. I'm the director of this exhibition, remember? "
"Jalil"|"Marinette"|0.508893847465515|" Then you also know that Tutankhamun wanted to bring his princess back to life, by offering the sun god a new wife. This seemed to illustrate the ritual he devised. Nobody has ever fully deciphered the hieroglyphics, but I have! It's a magic chant that needs to be recited in order to complete the ritual! I'm sure of it! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.166916012763977|" He kinda reminds me of someone else with crazy ideas... you! "
"Alya"|"Mr. Kubdel"|0.239447832107544|" You might think my theories about Ladybug are crazy, but you watch, girl, I'll prove you wrong. "
"Mr. Kubdel"|"Jalil"|0.570874214172363|" Jalil, these types of frescoes are almost always the illustration for a legend. They called it a legend for a reason... "
"Jalil"|"Mr. Kubdel"|0.445658802986145|" That's what everyone thinks. But I know it's real. I can prove it! "
"Mr. Kubdel"|"Jalil"|0.156360626220703|" Really? Exactly how are you going to prove it? "
"Jalil"|"Mr. Kubdel"|0.452678084373474|" I just need to get my hands on Tutankhamun's scepter and recite the spell! "
"Mr. Kubdel"|"Jalil"|-0.702690094709396|" Are you serious? Don't even think of touching that scepter. I'd lose my job on the spot. It's a priceless historical object! Not a toy! "
"Jalil"|"Mr. Kubdel"|0.217536807060242|" Come on, dad! We have to try out the spell! What if Tutankhamun had found out how to bring people back to life? "
"Mr. Kubdel"|"Hawk Moth"|0.411912441253662|" Listen, Jalil! That's enough! Get your head out of those papyrus scrolls and focus on the real world! This one! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Marinette"|0.16955554485321|" There's nothing wrong with living out a fantasy. Especially when I can make it a reality.Fly away, my evil akuma, and transform that young man!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.738647103309631|" Uhhh... ahhh... "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.123653292655945|" Gah! Put that down! I'm gonna show you the secret I found out about Ladybug! "
"Alya"|"Hawk Moth"|0.668310284614563|" 'Bout time. This better be blog-worthy. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Jalil"|0.634502768516541|" Pharaoh, I am Hawk Moth. I have endowed you with the magical power of the ancient gods. You must do me a favor in return for this gift. "
"Jalil"|"Marinette"|0.419299125671387|" My precious Nefertiti will come back to life!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.738647103309631|" Uhhh.. ahhh... "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.725995659828186|" This thing's making my eyes hurt."
"Marinette"|"Museum employee"|0.253103971481323|" Look closely! It is in there.Huh? "
"Museum employee"|"The Pharaoh"|0.0978981256484985|"Hey, you! "
"The Pharaoh"|"Marinette"|0.187052369117737|" Thoth, give me time!"

"The Pharaoh"|"Marinette"|-0.523963034152985|" Get out of here, faster!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.164726614952087|" Time to transform! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.443314373493195|" Tikki, spots on! Ha!"
"Alya"|"Plagg"|0.655393838882446|"OMG. Coming to you live, Ladyblog viewers, I'm at the scene even before Ladybug or Cat Noir! This is insane! "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.740423083305359|" Wow! I love the face changes! You could use that one! "
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|0.164726614952087|" Time to transform! "
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Ladybug"|"The Pharaoh"|-0.452479124069214|" You know that's considered stealing. "
"The Pharaoh"|"Ladybug"|-0.245351612567902|" Actually, I'm taking back what rightfully belongs to me. "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.500053882598877|" Maybe if you were the real Pharaoh, which you're not! "
"Alya"|"The Pharaoh"|-0.629243701696396|" Look at Ladybug go! If I'm dreaming, don't wake me up!Ladybug waved at me! No way! "
"The Pharaoh"|"Cat Noir"|0.479059100151062|" Sekhmet, give me your strength!"
"Cat Noir"|"The Pharaoh"|0.657745122909546|" How nice of you to hold the door open for me!"
"The Pharaoh"|"Alya"|0.396451950073242|" Enjoy your coffin!"

"The Pharaoh"|"Alya"|0.507612228393555|"Your face. Fate has placed you on my path. Come with me!"
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.22980147600174|" Hey! Hands off the threads. I can walk myself! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.486921668052673|"Seriously?!Let her go! "
"Cat Noir"|"The Pharaoh"|-0.797343447804451|" Hiding behind an innocent bystander! You're weak, Pharaoh! "
"The Pharaoh"|"Alya"|0.384657979011536|" I'm way more powerful than you are."
"Alya"|"Cat Noir"|0.666238069534302|"And don't forget! All the latest behind-the-scenes are on my blog! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.510810017585754|" That Alya is one brave chick. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.227416634559631|" If by brave, you mean bossy, feisty, and bold? Yup, that's her! Come on, get us out of here, Cat Noir! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.444047451019287|" Cataclysm!How are we gonna find them? "

"Alya"|"The Pharaoh"|0.032099723815918|" Ahh, hmmm. Gotcha! You're talking about the spell on the papyrus, right? "
"The Pharaoh"|"Alya"|0.61426854133606|" Correct! The one hundred mummies and the offering! "
"Alya"|"The Pharaoh"|0.336359977722168|" Offering. What offering? "
"The Pharaoh"|"Alya"|0.66352903842926|" To persuade the sun god Ra to give me my sweet princess, I must give him something in return. A pure soul! "

"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.028407871723175|" Oh, do you seriously think this mumbo-jumbo with the sun and mummy stuff is gonna work?"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.756134793162346|" You have no respect. Your batteries are charged up enough! "
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.696077615022659|" I don't see her or Pharaoh. "
"Cat Noir"|"Alya"|0.368683218955994|" Over there! "
"Alya"|"The Pharaoh"|0.386458277702332|"Whoa, back up! Who's that goddess chick with the black spots! There, on your papyrus! "
"The Pharaoh"|"Alya"|-0.411292135715485|" Ladybug, my sworn enemy! My nemesis may have kept me from carrying out my ritual 5000 years ago, but she will not stop Nefertiti from coming back to me this time! "
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.310987532138824|" Did you say... Ladybug 5000 years ago?! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.225721716880798|" Everyone does have a past they can learn from. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.362302601337433|" Well, you don't look a day over 3000. "
"Ladybug"|"The Pharaoh"|0.434838652610779|" Now you know why I'm so much wiser than you. Hm! "
"The Pharaoh"|"Mummies"|0.677162408828735|"Oh, sacred Ra, god of the sun, I Pharaoh, offer to thee a pure soul!

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.230843007564545|" Hold back the mummies while I take on the Pharaoh. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.74764546751976|" Why do I have to deal with these freaks while you get to slip calmly round back? "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.175792515277863|" Because I'm the only one who can capture his akuma, and because you are the bravest one out of both of us!"
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|0.554346323013306|" Sure. "
"Cat Noir"|"Mummies"|-0.512512892484665|" I know you don't really think that, but I'll pretend you do. "

"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.678570747375488|" Not until Ladybug destroys the pendant containing the akuma, and turns everything back to normal! I pay attention. "
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.708829283714294|" The pendant! Good eye! "
"Alya"|"Alya"|-0.683888405561447|"Ahhh! "

"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.520848661661148|" This offering isn't good enough for Nefertiti! "
"Alya"|"The Pharaoh"|0.461456060409546|" Hey! Thanks a lot! "
"The Pharaoh"|"Ladybug"|-0.168375015258789|" Too late, Ladybug! The ritual has begun! "
"Ladybug"|"The Pharaoh"|0.132998704910278|" Set Alya free and sacrifice me instead! Wouldn't that be the sweetest revenge? 5000 years later! After all, I'm the one who kept Nefertiti from you all these years! "

"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.250163316726685|" Thanks, Ladybug! But, uh, I still gotta ask: how old are you, really? "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.156107068061829|" Um, much older than a high school student, that's for sure!"
"Cat Noir"|"Alya"|-0.33969509601593|" Don't you wanna know how old I am? "
"Alya"|"Alya"|-0.336130559444427|" In a sec, looks like I'll be able to tell for myself. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.265009641647339|" Where have you been? "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.0542356967926025|" You won't believe this! I got mummified! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.419202029705048|" Hope you weren't one of the ones trying to swap me for Nefertiti! Creepy! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.625063538551331|" What?! You were almost... sacrificed? "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.00494879484176636|" If it hadn't been for you I'd never have found out that Ladybug is at least 5000 years old! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.665590286254883|" Hey! What are friends for? "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.288675785064697|" I still don't get it though, what was she doing with that tenth grade history textbook? "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.437937796115875|" Uh, she... she probably had to find out what's been going on for the past 50 centuries! "
"Alya"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.616949379444122|" You're probably right. It's tough staying in the loop. Hey, Ladybug's textbook! It's gone!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Marinette"|-0.28002667427063|"You might have gotten away this time, but I assure you, Ladybug, some day, wherever you are, I will have your Miraculous, and you'll be nothing! Nothing at all!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.172595858573914|" I don't get it. I know I'm not 5000 years old, so... who exactly was that Ladybug in the papyrus? "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.518975496292114|" Kwamis like me and superheroes like you have always existed! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.416360676288605|" So...that wasn't you in the papyrus either? "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.598075389862061|" What do you think? "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.664725035429001|" You don't look 5000 years old. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.119685530662537|" Well, I'm not! I'm older than that! I'm the kwami who's watched over every single Ladybug since the very beginning! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.578716963529587|" You must have known much less klutzy Ladybugs than me, right? "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.132114171981812|" Every Ladybug is different. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.265036821365356|" That's what I thought. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.647064805030823|" Marinette, you are different. But different as in surprising, unpredictable and endearing. And very talented. You learn fast. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.319303929805756|" Really? "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.097578763961792|" Yes.You better get to sleep. Remember, you have that history test tomorrow! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.203436613082886|" Oh yeah! Good thing it's on Ancient Egypt. "
"Plagg"|"Nathalie"|0.478791117668152|" Whoa! "
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|0.436890125274658|"Ready to go, Adrien?"
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|0.602162957191467|"Nathalie, since this is gonna take a while, can I bring a friend? "
"Nathalie"|"Nino"|-0.560151398181915|"Hmm."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.156728804111481|" Whassup, bro?"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|0.667514562606812|" Nino, I've got to go back to the Grévin Wax Museum. Do you want to come with me this time?"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.757691621780396|" Sure thing, dude. I'll be right there—Uh, eh, actually, Alya and I are hanging together today.Wait! Do you think Alya could come too?"
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|0.385419130325317|" Can I bring two friends? "
"Nathalie"|"Alya"|-0.560151398181915|"Hmm."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.0561403036117554|" Hey, wait! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.568951368331909|" Hey, girl."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.467135071754456|" Marinette, you are coming with me and Nino to the Grévin Wax Museum. Adrien invited us!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.656087934970856|" Ah! Wha! But! Nuh—!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.521679222583771|" There's no saying no. We're coming to get you now. You don't have a choice, girl!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.258520722389221|"Do you think Marinette could come too? That way you two guys could—"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.69317352771759|" Shhh!"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.609188795089722|" Uh, you could... stare at the statues together! Marinette loves the... she loves statues! Which is perfect since the wax museum is, uh, full of them! "
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|0.616279721260071|" Can we make that... three? "
"Nathalie"|"Manon"|0.393288373947144|"Mhmm."
"Manon"|"Marinette"|-0.735549747943878|" But Marinette!What about my superhero costume?Hmph, everyone always forgets about me."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.675503820180893|" Sorry, guys. I'm looking after Manon this afternoon. Go ahead without me."
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|-0.1021448969841|" Would four work? Actually, more like three and a half."
"Nathalie"|"Alya"|0.564885973930359|" I'll see what I can do."
"Alya"|"Manon"|-0.713283121585846|"You leave Adrien alone, and then, I'll leave Marinette alone..."
"Manon"|"Marinette"|-0.675947904586792|" Hey! Why are you leaving Marinette all alone? Don't you like her?"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.550376951694489|" Huh, what're you guys talking about?"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.65358978509903|" Nothing! It's got nothing to do with us leaving you and Adrien alone...Uh...! To... look at the statues as, uh, just friends, of course. "
"Adrien"|"Manon"|-0.509750634431839|" Don't worry, Manon. It's just that Alya and Nino are boyfriend and girlfriend, and they probably wanna spend some time alone together. Without us. "
"Manon"|"Adrien"|-0.600616544485092|" Really? But I thought you and Marinette were boyfriend and girlfriend.She has lots of photos of you all over her bedroom."
"Adrien"|"Manon"|0.42071533203125|"That's because she loves fashion and I'm a fashion model."
"Manon"|"Marinette"|0.0776413679122925|" But then why are there so many hearts drawn on them?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.381784617900848|"Those aren't heart! Those are, uh, upside-down spades! I was just coming up with some new, uh, patterns, for my fabric designs.You told me you wouldn't tell Nino!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.632610589265823|" I haven't told him. Right, Nino? I didn't tell you anything. "
"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.503647357225418|" She didn't tell me. And besides, I told her I won't tell."
"Marinette"|"Manon"|-0.70970207452774|" So you didn't tell anyone what Alya didn't tell you. Or did you?"
"Manon"|"Marinette, Nino, & Alya"|-0.590776652097702|" What are you guys talking about?"
"Marinette, Nino, & Alya"|"Adrien"|-0.709727585315704|" Nothing."
"Adrien"|"Véronique"|0.403895378112793|" Hi, Véronique."
"Véronique"|"Manon"|-0.636066675186157|" Thanks for coming on such short notice, Adrien. I'm sorry, but a piece of your statue went missing yet again!Just goes to show how popular you are."
"Manon"|"Alya"|-0.619255721569061|" Look Marinette, we get to go in, even though it's closed! It's like we're princesses.Hey! Did you hear me? "
"Alya"|"Manon"|-0.63148757815361|"Be careful this time, right? Marinette's the only one that's gotta spill the beans to Adrien— not us! So no matter what Adrien asks you, just deny. Okay? "
"Manon"|"Véronique"|-0.599233001470566|"Ahaha, wheee!Mr. Jagged! Can you give me an 'autygraph,' please?Why isn't anyone paying attention to me today!?"
"Véronique"|"Manon"|-0.288348019123077|"That's because this isn't the real Jagged Stone. It's a wax statue of him. The Grévin Wax Museum is the kingdom of illusions!"
"Manon"|"Véronique"|-0.049376904964447|" Woah! But he looks for reals! "
"Véronique"|"Adrien"|0.403852939605713|"The museum opened in 1882. We have about 200 wax statues on exhibition at any one time. We bring new celebrities in on a regular basis, the most recent one being Adrien!"
"Adrien"|"Flashback Alya"|0.709436655044556|"So if I've got this right, you and Alya wanna spend some alone time together, yeah?"
"Flashback Alya"|"Nino"|-0.579970896244049|" So no matter what Adrien asks you, just deny."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.589036852121353|" Not at all! That's not why we came here at all."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|0.71563720703125|" Oh! Well, then it's real nice of you guys to come here just to keep me company. "
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.244897723197937|" That's not why we came here at all, either!"
"Adrien"|"Nino"|0.201332807540894|" Really? So why did you want to come here then? Did it have something to do with Marinette?"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.615464895963669|" Uh, no! You've got it all wrong, dude.Not with Marinette, or with you, and even less with you and Marinette alone by yourselves! "
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.389465510845184|" I'm confused. Marinette wants to be alone with me?"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.616914689540863|"Marinette alone with you? Uh, no way, dude! You couldn't be further from the truth. It's the exact opposite, actually. "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.725668430328369|" Marinette doesn't want to be with me? "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.410419464111328|" Ah! Manon, come here! "
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.750713840126991|" Does she hate me?"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.253389775753021|" No, no! Dude, she likes you a lot! I mean, no! I mean, yes? I mean... barely! She barely likes you a lot, so there you have it. "
"Adrien"|"Véronique"|-0.719966560602188|" You sure? I'd be really bummed if I knew Marinette didn't like me. "
"Véronique"|"Marinette"|0.164210915565491|" The museum opened in 1882. We have about 200 wax statues..."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.651722490787506|" Why did you tell Nino everything? You promised you wouldn't."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.470860421657562|" I didn't, I swear! Besides, even if I had told him everything, he would still be clueless. Ugh! Who cares anyway? I've set everything up with Nino, who doesn't know a thing, so you can finally pour your heart out to Adrien, girl! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.514235883951187|" Wait, what?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.420810341835022|" We'll take off, leaving you two solo. Then you can spill your beans."
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.612609833478928|" Ah! Ahh! "
"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.579077780246735|"Not with Marinette, or with you, and even less with you and Marinette alone by yourselves! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.606242805719376|" No! Not like that! I'm so not ready. I'd have to practice first, and wash my hair, and I'm not even wearing my lucky socks. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.28982937335968|" It's up to you, girl. But I'm just telling you: today's the day."
"Marinette"|"Manon"|0.527700185775757|"Manon, come here! "
"Manon"|"Marinette"|0.740926861763|"Look, Marinette! My mommy's a famous person too. "
"Marinette"|"Véronique"|0.13461434841156|" Yeah. Yeah, right. Okay. "
"Véronique"|"Théo"|0.54965341091156|" Welcome to the workshop! This is where our sculptors create and repair all of our statues.And this is where we store our wax. It comes straight from our very own beehives up on the roof of the museum. "
"Théo"|"Veronique"|0.366163730621338|" So I heard we have to do your hand again. Right, Véronique?"
"Veronique"|"Nino"|0.0354734659194946|"Mmhmm."
"Nino"|"Théo"|0.668912887573242|"The beard's really well done."
"Théo"|"Véronique"|0.212577223777771|" It's genuine yak hair. "
"Véronique"|"Théo"|-0.438062071800232|"Okay, we have to leave you for a while, if you don't mind."
"Théo"|"Adrien"|0.0308780670166016|"It'll ding when it's over. We'll be back as soon as possible. "
"Adrien"|"Manon"|0.636907577514648|" Take your time. "
"Manon"|"Nino"|0.51768696308136|"Oh! I didn't know Nino was a famous person, too!"
"Nino"|"Manon"|-0.689598321914673|" Boo!"
"Manon"|"Marinette"|0.357815742492676|"My turn! My turn! I wanna play statues, too! Marinette!C'mon! Let's go and play hide and seek and statues in the museum!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.630760163068771|" We can't, Manon. We came here to keep Adrien company. "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.237215161323547|" We'll play with you. Marinette, you take good care of Adrien. He must not get bored a single second!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.578176498413086|" Uh, what? But I—! No! Don't leave me alone with him!I mean— That's not what I meant to say... I just... I..."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.770556509494781|" Are you mad at me, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.555800676345825|"No! Of course not. Why would you say that?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.253156304359436|" Because, Nino told me..."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.688206076622009|" I have no idea what Nino told you, but whatever he said, it's totally not true."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.575282335281372|" Oh, so that means you like me, right? I was afraid you didn't like me."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.453345775604248|" Of course I like you... Well, like, uh, like! But, not like that!What I mean is, you're not exactly a 'good friend,' you know?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.47248637676239|"Uh, okay...But then, if I'm not a good friend, what am I to you?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.370107889175415|" You're...Toilets! I— I really gotta go to the toilet now. Eee! "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.6573086977005|" See you later."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.780767977237701|"Oooh, Aadrieeen! What is it with the girrrls?? At least you don't have these kinds of troubles with cheeeese!"
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.721218109130859|"Stop pranking, Plagg. Put that head back down before you cataclysm it. "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.51718458533287|"I'm sure I did something to mess up our friendship by accident. I'm so clueless about these things! "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.515446186065674|"Huh?"
"Adrien"|"Alya"|0.00141751766204834|"I gotta make it up to her. "
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.356897830963135|"Manon, where are you hiding!? "
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.650543093681335|" Wow!Excuse me, lady, what exactly is your superpower, making me fall super in love?"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.281883895397186|" I don't need a super power for that.I know that we're not really ourselves when we're akumatized, but it's... weird to see ourselves like that, as supervillians."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.707625776529312|" It's because you don't look at them properly. These aren't supervillains, these are all the people Ladybug and Cat Noir have saved."
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.385132908821106|" You're right.Hey! What're you doing?"
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.55734646320343|" Oooh! I've been akumatized, now I'm Tickle Man!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.658748209476471|"No, not the tickles!Help! Ladybug, Cat Noir! "
"Nino"|"Manon"|0.357172131538391|"I'm gonna tickle!"

"Hawk Moth"|"Manon"|-0.453099071979523|"Puppeteer, glad to see you again. So, no one wants to play with you, huh? I'm giving you the power to play with them!"
"Manon"|"Marinette"|0.673585057258606|"We'll have lots of fun! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.126254022121429|"Uhhh! I'm so tired of not being able to just tell him how I feel! But I'm so scared, Tikki, always so scared he'll reject me."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.261713266372681|" You're overthinking it. You should try a game where you play a different character!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.584295272827148|" Like... like role playing?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.529002547264099|" Yes! And you're playing a super cool character who's not afraid of anything!"
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|0.653658747673035|" Yeah! Role playing!I can do that!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.117606222629547|" Seriously, who cares about friendship?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.728027820587158|" Marinette's important to me, so I'll do whatever it takes to make her feel good when she's around. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.40193510055542|" Like, giving her cheese? "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.685162663459778|" Like, cheering her up! Making her laugh, doing pranks like you always do for me.Hm? "

"Adrien"|"Alya"|-0.637337207794189|"Forgive me... even after all these months with you guys I guess I'm still not used to being a good friend..."

"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.610812932252884|"So you didn't really mean all the things you just said?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.552583664655685|" Of course not, I was role playing! I was in love with a statue, not with you!If I'd feel anything for you, it wouldn't be like for that statue, rather like, for a... regular human being! "
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.0747435092926025|" Okay... So, as I am a human being, you must still like me a bit then, right?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien and Marinette"|0.460858345031738|"That's right, I like you a little bit, just like a regular human being!Can somebody throw me into a vat of wax right now, please? "

"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.385572552680969|" The Hero's Room! That's where she found Hawk Moth's statue!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.501825928688049|" After you, m'lady. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.356300532817841|" Look out!It's not her, it's a statue! Look,the real Puppeteer had a wand, remember?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.0752044916152954|" Then this Puppeteer must've taken it. That's where the akuma must be!Okay, who wants to play red light, green light?Nobody's up for hopscotch, either? "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.213011264801025|" Enough jokes, Kitty— There's a little girl at stake! "

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.315108895301819|"It's precisely when something is important, that it's important to say it, no matter what."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.575997591018677|"The workshop— She's gotta be there! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.786219790577888|"Got it!Ahh, that's so gross! Ah! "

"Puppeteer"|"Ladybug"|-0.713087141513824|" I don't know, my wand stopped working!"
"Ladybug"|"Puppeteer"|-0.763798803091049|" Surprise!I swapped them earlier. You lose, Puppeteer!"
"Puppeteer"|"Ladybug"|-0.415882050991058|" Heh! I don't care! If you break my wand, I'll just turn them into real wax statues! "
"Ladybug"|"Puppeteer"|-0.477668285369873|" No! Don't do that! Fine, I'll give you your wand back."
"Puppeteer"|"Ladybug"|0.436235666275024|"Huh? What is that? Hey!If you're the real one, then that means that—! Ah! "

"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.638675928115845|"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have kissed the statue, but I didn't know it was you, and if I had, it wouldn't have been a prank because I—"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.766348406672478|" No, no... It's my fault. When you left the workshop, I was so worried that you were mad at me...? It made me do the stupid prank, and..."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.587392598390579|" Of course I wasn't mad at you! I'm sorry that I made you believe that."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.602390170097351|" Is that true? We're still friends, you and me?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.411951541900635|" Of course! But, to be safe, maybe we should stop playing pranks on each other."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.757849797606468|"I know, I'm not good with jokes. The girl I'm in love with doesn't like them either."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.122002840042114|" The girl that you—? You're... you're in love with...?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.131412863731384|" Are you okay, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.701940894126892|" Yeah, yeah. I'm glad we're friends. "

"Marinette"|"Manon"|0.199987649917603|" Yeah, but win what?"
"Manon"|"Marinette"|0.208928823471069|" I don't know. What do they usually want?"
"Marinette"|"Manon"|-0.143023550510406|" Depends. Lady Wifi wanted to reveal Ladybug's true identity and Evillustrator wanted to get revenge on a girl for making fun of him! Then there was Rogercop. But the evil Hawk Moth, who makes them bad, wants to take Ladybug's and Cat Noir's jewels from them! Their Miraculouses!"
"Manon"|"Marinette"|-0.195390164852142|" And what would happen if he did get them?"
"Marinette"|"Manon"|-0.267160534858704|" The bad guys... would win!"
"Manon"|"Marinette"|0.0431438684463501|" I know! I know what the bad guys want! We want the Miraculous! Then we'll win! Forever and ever! I'm gonna get your Miraculous, Ladybug and Cat Noir! You-you goody two-shoeses! You'll be super-duper sorry!"

"Manon"|"Marinette"|0.355815291404724|" Oh yeah? "
"Marinette"|"Manon"|0.575277805328369|" Yay! Ladybug and Cat Noir have won again!"
"Manon"|"Marinette"|-0.655159831047058|" No fair!! You always win!! "
"Marinette"|"Manon"|-0.0653780102729797|" Ladybug and Cat Noir always win, and the bad guys always lose."
"Manon"|"Marinette"|-0.654395163059235|" But you never let me play with Ladybug and Cat Noir!"
"Marinette"|"Nadja"|0.00899302959442139|" Oh, don't cry! Of course you can play with Ladybug and Cat Noir! I'll even let you borrow one of them if you want. "
"Nadja"|"Manon"|0.662827014923096|" I'm back, Manon. Have you been a good girl?"
"Manon"|"Nadja"|-0.720387160778046|" Mommy!! Marinette didn't let me win!!She didn't play fair and square!!"

"Manon"|"Marinette"|-0.610822319984436|" NO! I wanna keep it!"
"Marinette"|"Nadja"|0.6621413230896|" She can if she wants. I told her she could borrow it."
"Nadja"|"Manon"|0.361530303955078|" And that's sweet of you, Marinette, but Manon already has so many toys at home, I wouldn't even know where to put it."
"Manon"|"Nadja"|-0.540045082569122|" NO!Huh?"
"Nadja"|"Marinette"|-0.536130130290985|" Look what you've done, Manon! Give it to me. I'm sorry, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Najda"|-0.638015687465668|" Oh, it's nothing, I can sew it up again! It's no problem, really."
"Najda"|"Manon"|-0.559491574764252|" Oh, thank goodness! Come on, Manon, we're leaving. Say goodbye."

"Manon"|"Nadja"|-0.425926148891449|"Goodbye."
"Nadja"|"Manon"|-0.244760632514954|"Hi, Alec. Huh? Didn't I leave it for you on my desk at the station? "
"Manon"|"Nadja"|-0.318076074123383|" Uh, I left my bag up there, mommy!"
"Nadja"|"Tikki"|-0.110687792301178|" Go quickly and get it!It's not there, huh?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.609508991241455|" I think our heroes are in need of a little TLC!"
"Marinette"|"Manon"|0.587957262992859|" Manon! What are you-"
"Manon"|"Marinette"|-0.299962401390076|" I left my bag here!Can I have Ladybug?"
"Marinette"|"Manon"|-0.165024697780609|" You heard what your mom said."
"Manon"|"Marinette"|-0.514789640903473|" She wouldn't know if I hide it!"
"Marinette"|"Manon"|-0.663477033376694|" Sorry, but I have to sew her up!"

"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.533837884664536|" What!? No she didn- ugh. You know Tikki, I can't say no to those-"
"Tikki"|"Manon"|-0.727190554141998|" Baby doll eyes? Just be glad none of Ladybug's baddies have them! You'd be rendered powerless!"
"Manon"|"Manon"|-0.0690354108810425|"Here I am, baddie! Haha! I've saved Paris again!"
"Manon"|"Nadja"|-0.649825632572174|"No! No fair! You always win!"

"Nadja"|"Manon"|-0.752830103039742|"Wha...? This is one of Marinette's dolls. You took it after I specifically told you not to!"
"Manon"|"Nadja"|-0.0256499648094177|" But, Marinette wanted me to have it!"
"Nadja"|"Manon"|-0.688426226377487|" You disobeyed me. I told you the dolls were to stay at her house. You won't be needing these anymore."

"Mr. Kubdel"|"Alix"|-0.0433363914489746|" No, this is a special birthdayThis family heirloom was made by one of our ancestors many, many years ago. It's been passed down from one generation to the next, on their 15th birthday. And today, it's your turn to inherit it."
"Alix"|"Mr. Kubdel"|0.475334048271179|" It's pretty sweet, dad. But I've already got a watch, synced up to my smartphone."
"Mr. Kubdel"|"Mr. Kubdel"|0.38569974899292|" But sometimes there's more to things than meets the eye. Let's just say that our ancestor was…Ahead of his time. "
"Mr. Kubdel"|"Alix"|-0.270093739032745|" Of course, I'd understand if you'd rather me buy you a new pair of rollerblades."
"Alix"|"Mr. Kubdel"|0.00208461284637451|" No, Dad! I'm stoked to have it. It's awesome, thank you! "

"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.5900057554245|" I might be able to do it if you weren't distracting me so much with your encouraging words! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.488797307014465|" Hey Alya. What's up? The what? The bet between Alix and Kim? No, of course, I didn't forget! I already made the banner for it! I know everyone's counting on me. In 5 minutes?! No sweat. I'm on my way already. Be right there! Eek!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.345120489597321|" But Marinette, you have to wait for Mrs. Chamack to pick up her cake!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.554324865341187|" Gahhh! I've got 20 minutes before she gets here. I told them I'd take care of the banner and they're all counting on me! Besides, Adrien will be there too!"

"Marinette"|"Unknown"|-0.334319233894348|" Not too far for Ladybug.Tikki, spots on!"
"Unknown"|"Adrien"|0.686248660087585|" Oh, that's beautiful!"
"Adrien"|"Kim"|0.387809038162231|" Impressive, Marinette! "
"Kim"|"Alix"|-0.658382743597031|" You all picked the wrong side to cheer on. Looks like Alix isn't even showing up! Probably too chicken to race an extreme athlete like me."
"Alix"|"Kim"|-0.765165209770203|" Spoke too soon, Kim.Your ridiculous bets are over. I'm gonna leave you in the dust, meathead!"
"Kim"|"Alya"|-0.793698951601982|" You're no match for me. My neck is bigger than your thigh."

"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.215287625789642|" Yeah, but if I want a chance to see that future, we're gonna have to defeat Timetagger today."
"Adrien"|"Alix"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Alix"|"Ladybug"|0.378359317779541|" Crazy! So the message was for real."
"Ladybug"|"Alix"|0.0805569887161255|" What message?"
"Alix"|"Watch"|0.528823971748352|"This watch has been in my family since forever. It's never chimed, until today! And there was a message for you, Ladybug. "
"Watch"|"Ladybug"|0.521734237670898|"Nice work, Minibug, you're right on time. Now, dig as deep as you can into the past and you will find the rabbit's burrow. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.360511183738708|" Dig deep into the past?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.0972449779510498|" Did you also inherit a shovel to go with your watch, by any chance?Uh, shovel, you know? For all this deep digging. "
"Ladybug"|"Alix"|0.552316904067993|"Of course! What's the oldest exhibit in the museum?"
"Alix"|"Ladybug"|0.515754222869873|" The Egyptian collection! My old man says some of it dates back more than five thousand years!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.486432552337646|" There, it sounds hollow! Do your thing, Kitty."
"Cat Noir"|"Bunnyx"|-0.726003736257553|" Cataclysm! "
"Bunnyx"|"Bunnyx"|-0.0779680609703064|"Minibug, Kitty, I knew you'd solve my riddle. A basic security measure in case the watch is stolen. But now, I need to do something very important."
"Bunnyx"|"Cat Noir"|0.602615833282471|" My name's Bunnyx. And in the future, I'm a member of Ladybug and Cat Noir's team of superheroes. Well, the Ladybug and Cat Noir you're going to become, because right now, you two are more like Minibug and Kitty Noir. Within the team, I am the hero of the last chance. I'm called upon when everyone else has failed, that includes you two."
"Cat Noir"|"Bunnyx"|-0.762872233986855|" Ey! We just got you out of the stone, didn't we? Which means you must have failed somewhere, too."
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug"|-0.72852036356926|" Yes, well, no. It was actually your fault. Or more precisely, it will be. In the future, one of your cataclysms will accidently damage my Miraculous.That's how Timetagger will be able to send me into ancient Egypt and get me stuck in stone."
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|-0.421918332576752|" Wait, then how are we going to do that without the Rabbit Miraculous?"
"Bunnyx"|"Alix"|0.422586679458618|"Do you have the watch?"
"Alix"|"Bunnyx"|0.175220727920532|" My watch?!"
"Bunnyx"|"Alix"|0.504683017730713|" Yes, my watch. Our watch."
"Alix"|"Ladybug"|0.697737097740173|" So this was a Miraculous?!"
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|-0.473695695400238|" In camouflage mode."
"Bunnyx"|"Alix"|-0.623906910419464|"Fluff, counter-clockwise! "
"Alix"|"Future Alix"|-0.388652145862579|" But you are—"
"Future Alix"|"Alix"|0.226359367370605|" So, mini-me, you get it now? You're me and I'm you. Well, more precisely, I'm you when you grow up."
"Alix"|"Ladybug"|0.658281683921814|" Wow! I can't believe how cool I'm gonna be when I'm older!"
"Ladybug"|"Future Alix"|-0.63727217912674|" But wait, it doesn't make sense. I never gave you, I mean her , I mean… I never gave either of you the Miraculous."
"Future Alix"|"Alix"|0.173530101776123|" You haven't given it to us, yet, Minibug, because you haven't realised just how awesome I really am. But don't worry, you will, one day."
"Alix"|"Future Alix"|0.773092865943909|" I'm gonna get a Miraculous! So cool!"
"Future Alix"|"Fluff"|0.223430037498474|" Fluff, snack time! You have to recharge your batteries. "
"Fluff"|"Cat Noir"|0.489794015884399|" Hmm, was that breakfast, or dinner? What time will it be yesterday? Is it tomorrow already? When it'll be the day after tomorrow, it will have been yesterday again!"
"Cat Noir"|"Future Alix"|0.586722016334534|" That Miraculous seems so powerful, how come we don't use it more often?"
"Future Alix"|"Cat Noir"|-0.515332579612732|" Because traveling through time is very dangerous. Interfering with events can have serious consequences."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.0479668378829956|"Oops, time to feed my Kwami, too! "
"Ladybug"|"Future Alix"|-0.403980910778046|" I don't understand. If you're from the future, then you gotta know how this all ends. Your younger self has seen it with her own eyes. Which means you obviously know how to defeat Timetagger."
"Future Alix"|"Alix"|-0.071386456489563|" Actually, uh… I've spent so much time in stone, I can barely remember. But I think, the logical thing to do, would be to take Timetagger back to the future, so he can be defeated by heroes his own size.I'll take care of this."
"Alix"|"Future Alix"|0.759617209434509|" Awesome!"
"Future Alix"|"Alix"|0.528825640678406|" One thing I remember for sure is:mini-me has to be there when I defeat Timetagger. If she's still in my memory, she must play a vital role."
"Alix"|"Future Alix"|-0.388632774353027|" Good! I wasn't planning on sitting on the bench this time!"
"Future Alix"|"Cat Noir"|-0.626328319311142|" Fluff, clockwise!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.224379658699036|" Uh, guys, you should take a look at this, now."
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|-0.0337588787078857|"Timetagger sent Jagged Stone into the past!"
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug"|0.11881685256958|" That's Nadja Chamack!"
"Ladybug"|"Alix"|-0.0748454332351685|"André Glacier."
"Alix"|"Ladybug"|-0.38733184337616|"Mayor Bourgeois?!"
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|-0.739213407039642|" He's destroying our present by rewriting the past! Bunnyx, since the future me hasn't been able to stop Timetagger from coming here, they must not be that powerful."
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug"|-0.166540205478668|" Are you kidding?! You're – I mean, you will be an awesome team leader. The greatest superhero ever."
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|-0.130194664001465|" How do you explain Timetagger then?"
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug"|-0.32785028219223|" I told you earlier. If Cat Noir hadn't cataclysmed my Miraculous, Timetagger wouldn't be here. In the future you've defeated:Doctor Sadness; The Eclyptinvaders; Pain and Tears, the twin queens of the Interdimension; and Majestia, so believe me, you're not going to be intimidated by Timetagger. Oh, and I even forgot Monsieur Rat."
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|-0.333405077457428|" Monsieur Rat?"
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug"|0.315193891525269|" You can always count on Ladybug. With her around, every problem has a solution."
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|-0.608013153076172|" How will I ever get to be like that?"
"Bunnyx"|"Cat Noir"|0.257425785064697|" By growing up, Minibug."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.657404184341431|" Tell me, Bunnyx, in the future, are Ladybug and I like… "
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|-0.535250902175903|" Cat!"
"Bunnyx"|"Cat Noir"|0.193390727043152|" Oh, you and her it's always more like… "
"Cat Noir"|"Bunnyx"|-0.520285278558731|" Hey, the future isn't set in stone. "
"Bunnyx"|"Bunnyx"|0.676503419876099|" Okay, let's go!"
"Bunnyx"|"Cat Noir"|-0.450899958610535|" We've taken too long, he's had enough time to weave a giant time-web around us."
"Cat Noir"|"Bunnyx"|-0.401989758014679|" Surrounded by just one guy? Does that mean he can attack from anywhere?"
"Bunnyx"|"Timetagger"|-0.00743681192398071|" More like from any time."
"Timetagger"|"Bunnyx"|-0.271070122718811|"Gimme your Miraculous Don't make me ask It's pretty clear you're not up to the task When I bring them to Hawk Moth's door Ladybug and Cat Noir will be no more "
"Bunnyx"|"Timetagger"|-0.00523650646209717|" Stay where you are. I'll deal with him and take him back to the future you. It means nothing must happen to you in the meantime. But first...Stay right there, okay? Then it'll be exactly like it was in my memory. And now... Burrow!"
"Timetagger"|"Cat Noir"|-0.630162328481674|" Missed me!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.439720094203949|" She doesn't need to transform back before she uses her power again?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.682243585586548|" No, because she's an adult!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.761704325675964|" Awesome! I can't wait to grow up."
"Ladybug"|"Timetagger"|-0.335688054561615|" I don't think we're quite up to the job yet, Cat Noir."
"Timetagger"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.711611062288284|"Bunnyx, you're lame, you don't get the game And now you have to start all over again "
"Hawk Moth"|"Timetagger"|0.596691131591797|" My victory is close at hand. How brilliant from me to send myself such a powerful ally from the future."
"Timetagger"|"Cat Noir"|-0.748319894075394|" Where's your sad gun now, fluffytail?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.749264299869537|" I can't stand watching them playing cat and mouse like this. Cataclysm!"
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|-0.732834756374359|" Cat Noir, no!"
"Bunnyx"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.00445115566253662|" See?! In the future that's exactly how you damaged my Miraculous!I knew it! I knew you'd do that. Who's the best now, huh?"
"Hawk Moth"|"Bunnyx"|-0.740374833345413|"That– That's impossible!"
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug, Cat Noir and Alix"|-0.402562856674194|" Thanks for you involuntary help, my young friends. Now Bunnyx is going home! "
"Ladybug, Cat Noir and Alix"|"Bunnyx"|-0.52241525053978|" Bye, Bunnyx!"
"Bunnyx"|"Timetagger"|-0.110385715961456|" Wait a second. This is not the exact right moment."
"Timetagger"|"Timetagger"|0.379805088043213|" Enjoy your trip to the ice age, fluffytail!We've wasted enough time! Gimme your Miraculous now!"
"Timetagger"|"Bunnyx"|-0.498212873935699|" So, the ice age wasn't good enough for ya? Back to the cretaceous then!"
"Bunnyx"|"Timetagger"|-0.705762267112732|" Down, Denver, down!"
"Timetagger"|"Bunnyx"|-0.183601915836334|" You wanna keep playing, fluffytail?"
"Bunnyx"|"Timetagger"|-0.686827600002289|" Don't call me fluffytail!"
"Timetagger"|"Unknown"|0.277317404747009|"To the future, Seventh Interstellar War!"
"Unknown"|"Ladybug"|-0.803082600235939|" Disintegrate! Disintegrate!"
"Ladybug"|"Alix"|0.545336365699768|" Maybe we should give her a hand after all."
"Alix"|"Timetagger"|0.369508147239685|" You heard her, she's the only one who can solve this time problem. She can do it. Go Bunnyx!"
"Timetagger"|"Bunnyx"|0.425978779792786|"The heat is on!"
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug"|-0.638489872217178|" Sorry, Minibug, I just can't. Looks like this time I don't have a solution after all."
"Ladybug"|"Timetagger"|0.336403131484985|" What if today's the day we grow up? Lucky Charm!A block of paper?"
"Timetagger"|"Ladybug"|-0.645117551088333|" Hahahaha! What are you gonna do with that? Send a defeat treaty? Now gimme your Miraculous or I get rid of your friend by sending her back to the big bang."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir and Alix"|0.197160124778748|" Alright, you win. We'll give you our Miraculous. All I ask is that you give me a little bit of time, to write a letter, to apologize, to my future self."
"Cat Noir and Alix"|"Cat Noir"|-0.612575769424438|" What?!"
"Cat Noir"|"Timetagger"|-0.605348527431488|" No, think of something! You always think of something."
"Timetagger"|"Hawk Moth"|0.536198735237122|" Fair enough, Ladybug, wish granted."
"Hawk Moth"|"Timetagger"|-0.00732052326202393|"Be careful, it could be a trap."
"Timetagger"|"Ladybug"|-0.607036590576172|" If she thinks she can trick me, she's wasting her time. Pun intended. Hahaha!"
"Ladybug"|"Timetagger"|0.309792757034302|" I don't have a pen. Could anyone lend me one, please? "
"Timetagger"|"Ladybug"|0.588672995567322|" Time's up, my moment of victory has arrived."
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|-0.631294816732407|"Ugh, I can't find the words. It's pointless anyway. I won't even be Ladybug in the future after we give up our Miraculous. "
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug"|-0.693329691886902|" Please don't do this, Minibug!"
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|-0.746756225824356|" Some problems simply don't have a solution.Go back to your timestream, Bunnyx, make the most of your remaining time."
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug"|-0.697688221931458|" No, I refuse! I—"
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|0.272807955741882|"Who's the team leader in the future?Trust me."
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug"|-0.234866738319397|"Okay, Ladybug. Burrow. "
"Ladybug"|"Bunnyx"|0.487900376319885|" Come on, Cat Noir. We better give him our Miraculous."
"Bunnyx"|"Future Ladybug"|-0.722178101539612|" I'm sorry, Ladybug, I didn't deliver."
"Future Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.691626161336899|" Not true, Bunnyx. You didn't fail. Every problem has a solution."
"Hawk Moth"|"Timetagger"|0.662945032119751|"The future bird catches the worm. This time, the Miraculous are mine!"
"Timetagger"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.112399280071259|" You're right on the first count, but not on the second. The Miraculous are not for you."
"Hawk Moth"|"Timetagger"|-0.612575769424438|"What?!"
"Timetagger"|"Timetagger"|-0.348235845565796|" Hahaha! I said I was sent by the Hawk Moth of the future, but I never said that the Hawk Moth of the future was you!"
"Timetagger"|"Timetagger"|0.381581664085388|" Your earrings are mine, Babybug.And you, Kitty Noir, cataclysm this so I can take your ring safely after I'm finished with her.Good boy."
"Timetagger"|"Ladybug"|-0.586760878562927|" No!"
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.624045819044113|" Cat Noir!"
"Ladybug"|"Chris"|-0.584051758050919|" No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma. Time to de-evilise!Gotcha!Bye bye, little butterfly."
"Chris"|"Cat Noir"|0.0581865310668945|" Ladybug? And Cat Noir? You're so young! Where am I?"
"Cat Noir"|"Bunnyx"|0.13459575176239|" The question should be more like: when are you?"
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug"|-0.046387255191803|"C'mon, Chris, let's go home."
"Ladybug"|"Future Ladybug"|-0.0829697251319885|"Chris? "
"Future Ladybug"|"Alix"|0.4615159034729|"See girl? We did it. We always will."
"Alix"|"Bunnyx"|0.553490996360779|" Hey, future Ladybug, when am I gonna get my Miraculous?"
"Bunnyx"|"Ladybug"|0.129296064376831|" As soon as you're as cool as I am, mini-me."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.223827004432678|" Miraculous Ladybug! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.492810606956482|" Why doesn't anyone tell me how awesome I am?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.401549577713013|" Because you already know you're the best, Kitty Noir."
"Cat Noir"|"Alix"|-0.289436459541321|"I think we're gonna have to hurry, Bugaboo."
"Alix"|"Ladybug"|0.340251207351685|" Are we gonna see each other again soon?"
"Ladybug"|"All Three"|0.36393678188324|" No doubt about that."
"All Three"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.271977782249451|"Pound it!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Nooroo"|-0.370410025119781|" Nooroo, dark wings fall. "
"Nooroo"|"Gabriel"|0.492125988006592|" Master, I—"
"Gabriel"|"Gabriel"|-0.761655181646347|" Quiet, Nooroo."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|-0.70367419719696|" If I'm not Hawk Moth in the future, then that means I failed."
"Nathalie"|"Alya"|-0.403152465820312|" Or that you've succeeded. The future is not set in stone, Gabriel. "
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.3417067527771|"Hey there!"
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|-0.701089650392532|" Alya, it's Marinette! I'm sorry I won't be able to look after Chris and your sisters this afternoon. I— I hadn't finished my presentation for Monday, I hope you're not mad at me."
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|-0.43486487865448|" No, of course not, no biggy. A friend of mine said she'd take care of them, so Nino and I are going to see a movie."
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.691145062446594|" A friend?"
"Alya"|"Ladybug"|0.370537877082825|" Yeah, don't worry, she'll take care of everything."
"Ladybug"|"Alya"|0.75274121761322|" Perfect, enjoy your movie then. See you later! "
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.60925555229187|" Okay, we're going."
"Nino"|"Lila"|0.680701613426208|" Thanks again, Lila. "
"Lila"|"Chris"|0.514333724975586|"Do I know how to play Freestyle Clash? Please, I invented Freestyle Clash."
"Chris"|"Lila"|0.364816904067993|" Wow, for real?"
"Lila"|"Chris"|0.234943270683289|" Of course for real, I never lie."
"Chris"|"Mr. Ramier"|0.202627420425415|" You're so cool."
"Mr. Ramier"|"Ladybug"|-0.75438229739666|" I'm so sorry."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.649865478277206|" Don't worry. Every problem has a solution. We didn't discover it today, but we will next time."
"Cat Noir"|"Mr. Ramier"|-0.701708912849426|" The problem with Pigeons in Paris is that they have it too hard here. Maybe you should move to the suburbs, or try to make friends with some other type of animal. A goldfish for example. "
"Mr. Ramier"|"Ladybug"|0.405470967292786|" Another type of animal? That might be a good idea, Cat Noir. I'll think about it."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.57805323600769|" Okay, we have to get going. Thanks for the ice cream, Mr. Ramier. "
"Cat Noir"|"Mr. Ramier"|0.637694716453552|" Everything Bunnyx told us seems crazy. All those supervillains with weird names. Like doctor what's-his-name and Monsieur Rat? Monsieur Rat?!What kind of a codename is that?! Maybe in the future, you might even agree to go see a movie with me. Hey, what if it was in the very near future, say, the next show? I can get a ticket… "
"Mr. Ramier"|"Alya"|0.485164880752563|"Oh, hello! What are you? Hello, cutie.You're even cuter than a pigeon."
"Penny"|"Jagged"|0.373985290527344|" Mr. Stone would like his breakfast brought to him on the back of a polar bear. Could you arrange that for me, please?"
"Jagged"|"Butler Jean"|0.483563780784607|"Fetch!"
"Butler Jean"|"Penny"|0.556937336921692|" Uh...I'll see what I can do, Miss Penny. Will zat be all?"
"Penny"|"Bob"|-0.286846816539764|"Yes, a red-eye flight would be preferable. Jagged's crocodile, Fang, hates flying in the daytime."
"Bob"|"Penny"|0.664751887321472|" Penny, I found the perfect way to market his new album! He's gonna be a guest on a reality TV show!"
"Penny"|"Jagged"|-0.548964649438858|"I really don't think Jagged will be okay with it.No! No, I wasn't talking to you. Confirm that flight.Thanks a lot.Uh, I'll call you back.Bob, wait!"
"Jagged"|"Penny"|0.321527600288391|" Penny, did you remember to order those macaroons for Fang?"
"Penny"|"Bob"|0.518032312393188|" Of course; I'm taking care of that right now, Jagged. "
"Bob"|"Mayor Bourgeois"|0.163508653640747|"Your album's gonna go platinum and wait 'til you find out how!"
"Mayor Bourgeois"|"Penny"|-0.720518231391907|" I'm sorry, Miss Penny, but you cannot allow your crocodile to just roam around the hotel by itself."
"Penny"|"Jagged"|-0.718154191970825|"I'm sorry, Mr. Bourgeois.Yes, what— "
"Jagged"|"Penny"|-0.704340547323227|"What?! What is this trash?"
"Penny"|"Jagged"|0.653034806251526|" Thanks, Mr. Mayor. "
"Jagged"|"Bob"|-0.597143441438675|"You want me to be a guest on Rocker Wants a Wife?!There's nothing rock 'n' roll about that show. My fans will never watch it!"
"Bob"|"Jagged"|-0.431950390338898|" Of course they will, Jagged! This is how marketing works these days."
"Jagged"|"Butler Jean"|-0.529590904712677|" No way! I'm a genuine rock and roller, Bob!"
"Butler Jean"|"Jagged"|-0.708972811698914|"I am so sorry, Miss. There were no polar bears available. Would a pony do instead?"

"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.131412863731384|"Are you okay, Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.731558412313461|" I will never persuade my parents to shoot a TV show at our house again!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.610171288251877|" Not unless you want the whole world to know all your secrets!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.263145267963409|" I just need to stay on the down-low for a few days so everyone can forget all about what happened — especially Adrien!Mmnh! "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.604314625263214|"Phew! Hopefully, he didn't see me!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.633583903312683|" Hey, Marinette!How's it going? After what happened at your place last night, I was worried that—"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.0978565216064453|"Oh, so you watched the show, then!Well, uh, look...about what you saw on the show last night — the totographs, in my room—"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.254775762557983|" You mean the photographs?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.199288606643677|"The grotographs, exactly!It-it's not what you think.See...I'm really into fashion, and, umm..."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.605746299028397|"Are you lying?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.571550905704498|" No! I'm so not into you—I mean, sure, I'm interested in you, but, um, not in that way; well, you know, ha-ha-ha-ha...ha ha!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.668299227952957|"Just teasing.I understand; don't worry. I've got used to having lots of fans...and, photographs of me everywhere — even in the most unlikely places."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.332475602626801|"As if someone would have a picture of you under her bed, right?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.725226879119873|"Yeah. I was wondering; since you're into fashion so much, you could come watch my next photo shoot!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.683086097240448|" No way! For you?—peal—meal— For real?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.425284862518311|" Honestly, it's pretty long and boring, but if you were there, it would definitely be more fun! Whaddaya say?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.000996410846710205|"Oh wow! Yes!Thank you, Adrien."
"Adrien"|"Tikki"|0.692317128181458|" I'll keep you posted, then.See you later in class.I'm glad to have you as one of my fans. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.257064819335938|"Relax, Marinette. You can breathe now!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.626340508460999|"He invited me to one of his photo shoots! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.738662719726562|"Yeah, that's awesome! And, you even managed to get some normal sentences out, too!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.725650668144226|" Oh, come on! That's not funny!"
"Tikki"|"Penny"|-0.701993495225906|" You're totally right. It is not funny."
"Nathalie"|"Gabriel"|0.483235716819763|"Dust from the sky, now precious, will fix the wings of the injured animal. Combine the molten gold with the meteorite powder. Then, add the peacock feather. "
"Gabriel"|"Duusu"|0.685648679733276|" Miraculous, repair yourself!It's perfect, as good as new! Now it's completely safe to use."
"Duusu"|"Nooroo"|-0.744921863079071|"Wow, I feel so much better! What happened? Huh? Nooroo!Oh wow, everything was so chaotic in my head, like a nightmare where I'd fallen into very bad hands!"
"Nooroo"|"Gabriel"|-0.730635225772858|" Sorry, old friend, but I'm afraid the nightmare is not over yet. "
"Gabriel"|"Marinette"|-0.0627252459526062|" Nooroo, Duusu, Unify! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.496754765510559|" So... they all live in there?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.625896602869034|" Yes, except for Nooroo and Duusu, who are being held captive by the bad guys."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.734498292207718|" Master Fu never let them out? "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.544769793748856|"Only Kwamis like me who have a holder like you can go out into the human world, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.573686331510544|" But...isn't it a bit cramped in there?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.292149841785431|" Oh no! There's a whole parallel world inside! Of course, being out here is much more interesting. You humans are so inventive!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.691779673099518|"I thought they couldn't get out?"
"Tikki"|"Mullo"|0.588664889335632|" Now that you're the Guardian, the box has become just like you! Full of surprises! That's amazing!"
"Mullo"|"Tikki"|0.396910190582275|"Thanks Tikki!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.400115370750427|" Hey! Marinette made that for me!"
"Marinette"|"Daizzi"|0.20664393901825|"That's my secret diary!"
"Daizzi"|"Ziggy"|0.193806767463684|"Day! Night! Night! Day!"
"Ziggy"|"Marinette"|0.756126999855042|"Wow! It makes music, I love music! "
"Marinette"|"Kaalki"|-0.628162562847137|" Careful with my phone!"
"Kaalki"|"Kid"|-0.583622068166733|"Oh my, you have to see this! The carts are all moving on their own! There isn't a single horse here to pull them-"
"Kid"|"Marinette"|0.0731855630874634|"Look, mom!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.345214247703552|"Uh haha, it's a talking squishy, but it's not for sale yet! "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.593293190002441|"Oh, Alya! What do you think of my new squishies? Pretty cute, right?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.126046657562256|" What new squishies?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.611643075942993|" Uh- "
"Tikki"|"Ziggy"|-0.42267519235611|" Marinette, we're magical creatures, remember? We can't be seen or heard on screen or in photographs. "
"Ziggy"|"Marinette"|-0.296764016151428|" Ooh, so that's why I'm not showing up on these magic paintings!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.718401819467545|" Right, she can only see me and I look completely ridiculous, don't I?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.302772581577301|" Marinette, are you feeling okay? "
"Marinette"|"Rose"|0.687553644180298|"Aaah! Hey, girls! So happy to see you! Now is just the perfect time for a chat!"
"Rose"|"Marinette"|-0.281830608844757|"Did you say new squishies? Show us!"
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.230166912078857|" Uh... squishies? What squishies? .. Ah!"
"Alya"|"Roaar"|-0.308282434940338|" Marinette, you okay?"
"Roaar"|"Daizzi"|-0.145079493522644|" How'd your friends lock themselves in this picture frame? "
"Daizzi"|"Trixx"|0.565832495689392|" They look so cute.I want her as my holder."
"Trixx"|"Mullo"|-0.339249789714813|" She's taken."
"Mullo"|"Alya"|-0.590004771947861|"Why does Trixx get to have a holder when we don't? "
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.596342712640762|" Marinette, you're acting weirder than usual."
"Marinette"|"Mylène"|0.391534924507141|" Eh heh! I'm just... working out!I came up with this work out- it's uh- super special work out, hehe, to uh, be in shape before making squishies!"
"Mylène"|"Alya"|-0.539328247308731|" You should get some fresh air, you look overwhelmed."
"Alya"|"The girls"|-0.778107851743698|" Wait a minute: awkward gesturing, ridiculous babbling, weird excuses, clumsiness overload..."
"The girls"|"Marinette"|-0.0691795349121094|"...is Adrien there?!"
"Marinette"|"The girls"|0.30413818359375|" What? Of course not.Luka? "
"The girls"|"Juleka"|-0.540178209543228|"Luka..."

"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.751187443733215|" Hi, and thanks for the pictures."
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.062421441078186|" What do you mean \"thanks\"? "
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.613670706748962|" Thanks for the photos of your bedroomand of Adrien. "
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.586957931518555|" Ah, my room! Yeah, I- uh- it's full of photos of Adrien because I uh... I'm using them for fashion pics for my blog and I need your opinion on them because I know you have great taste, Adrien."
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.213900804519653|" My name is Luka. "
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.495640993118286|" Haha yes of course, Adrie- I mean, Luka. You're Luka, obviously, hehe, because you're you, and I am me, Marinette. Hehe, uh, I'm so sorry, it's just that I've been so busted- uh I mean, busy!"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.601764917373657|" No problem, Marinette, it's cool. So you ready? "
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.655861735343933|"Ready for what? "
"Luka"|"Sabine"|0.630552649497986|" Well... our date. "
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.214575171470642|"Marinette, Luka is waiting for you! "

"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.619269281625748|"Wasn't your date with Luka supposed to be yesterday? "
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.448899507522583|"No! I completely forgot about yesterday's date!"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.00760006904602051|"That's why we agreed that I'd come pick you up today, Marinette. It's the last screening, we can't miss it."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.450601637363434|"Of course, it would really be a shame to miss uh...the thing we're gonna watch at this screening."
"Tom"|"Sabine"|-0.295605897903442|" I can't believe they're showing it again! It was so silly when it came out 15 years ago, it can't be any better now."
"Sabine"|"Luka"|-0.612825453281403|" Oh honey, it was his first movie. Think about your first baguette, it was pretty bad, too. "
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.458649277687073|" Sure the movie's a bit mindless, but Marinette and I love him so much that we swore we'd see it together."
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.291352510452271|"I know! We're gonna see \"Crocodile Heart\", Jagged Stone's first movie."
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.562353938817978|" Did you forget?"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.57289320230484|"Of course, not! And I don't have any other emergencies right now either. So...come on, let's go."
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.236093878746033|" \"You are?..\" \"You are?..\""
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.408689618110657|"Is it \"you are the popcorn of my life\"?"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.251216888427734|"Nope. It was \"the donut of my life\"."
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.727500438690186|" Of course! \"The donut\", featured on the \"Candy Apple\" album! His food phase, my favorite! Two points for you."

"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.668982148170471|" Jagged came by the bakery the other day, so I asked him to sign it for you."
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.226306915283203|" The rules are clear, Marinette. This gift entitles you to a second round. \"Under the moonlight, by the sea...\""
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.735559105873108|" \"Under the moonlight, by the sea...\" Oh, it's on the tip of my tongue!I know! His very first song! \"Under the moonlight, by the sea, KISS ME!\" "
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.410501718521118|" Okay, I mean, if you want to."
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.479256629943848|" I do... want to. "
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.273214101791382|" What was that? "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.395725309848785|"Uh, probably the subway. It passes under the theater. I'm so thirsty all the sudden, I'm gonna go get some water. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.566049247980118|"You're gonna leave Luka there all alone?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.370569944381714|" What would I say? \"Be right back, Luka, gotta go fight some bad guys\" or \"Gotta go Luka, by the way, I'm Ladybug\"? Now that I'm the Guardian, I have to keep my identity a secret more than ever. Tikki, spots on!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.704321980476379|"Hey you, Bugaboo! Well, here I am, your faithful companion at our rendezvous point just like always. It's time for our daily patrol, I hope you haven't forgotten!Buga-Boo!waaah! "

"Woman inside building"|"Ladybug"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.577832192182541|" Will you cut it out with the practical jokes? I could have really hurt you!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.762530982494354|"M'lady, the only thing that really hurts me is when you make me go on patrol by myself.I even missed your little angry pout."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.734577178955078|" Sorry, Kitty Cat, I'm a bit over my head at the moment."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.661160707473755|" I bet! \"Guardian of the Miraculous\", big name, big responsibility!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.15632164478302|"I promise, I won't ever forget our patrols again."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.616905212402344|" Woohoo!"
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.298059701919556|"Phew, there was a huge line at the water fountain, so I went out to buy bottles at the corner market but then there was an akuma alert. We were stuck in the store and they wouldn't let us out. Good thing Ladybug saved everyone!Oh no, is it over already? "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.240906834602356|"Uh, the ice cream is gonna melt, we need napkins. I'll be quick!"
"Alya"|"Adrien"|-0.479446947574615|" Bye!"

"Luka"|"Rose"|0.631901502609253|" I'd like to dedicate this song to Marinette, a girl…who's not here as usual."
"Rose"|"Marinette"|0.691715598106384|"I love unicorns! I love unicorns! And cute little fluffy cats!"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.674564927816391|" I'm sorry about earlier. There were mosquitoes on the boat, I thought we needed some insect repellent but the drug store was closed so I had to-"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.0647298097610474|" Shh, listen, the song of the water. If you listen carefully at this very spot under the bridge, you'll hear a melody.You know, I never knew my father and my mom would never bring herself to tell me. So when I just couldn't deal with it all, I would take refuge here and the melody of the water would console me. What about you, Marinette? Where do you go when you disappear? "
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.611643075942993|" Uh-"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.0519185066223145|" You tell me, I'll accept it. If you're still in love with Adrien, I'll understand. I won't be jealous you know."

"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.212271809577942|" Whatever it is, I just want it to be the honest truth."
"Marinette"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.346599340438843|" The truth, Luka… is the only thing I can't tell you. "
"Shadow Moth"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.693269401788712|" Is there betrayal worse than the lies of the one you love?Fly away my evil akuma, fly my beautiful amok, and rewrite the song of this heartbroken boy!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Luka"|0.174430847167969|" Truth, I am Shadow Moth. I'm giving you the power to force people to tell you their most sacred secrets. "
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.415110290050507|"Truth needs to be shared, not taken by force, Shadow Moth!"
"Marinette"|"Shadow Moth"|-0.691838204860687|"Uh! Shadow Moth? No! Luka, please resist, I am so sorry!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Luka"|-0.664548426866531|" Why should you resist when she doesn't trust you? "
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.588868737220764|" Marinette does trust me!"
"Marinette"|"Shadow Moth"|0.694199204444885|" I do! Of course I do!"
"Shadow Moth"|"Luka"|0.525493979454041|" If she trusted you, then she would tell you the truth!Accept my power and you will know everything. And all I ask of you in return is to expose Ladybug and Cat Noir's little secrets."

"Chloé"|"Nino"|0.194353103637695|" Why did Jagged Stone write a song about Lila when he could've written it about me?"
"Nino"|"Marinette"|0.548893570899963|" Lila knows all of the Hollywood directors. She promised she'd mention me toSteven Basielberghimself!"

"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.588262230157852|"What?! Don't say that! This is super bad, what if Adrien totally falls for her?! I've never flown in a private jet; nobody's ever written a song about me; and I don't know a single person in Hollywood! Adrien will forget I even exist! "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.5900539457798|"Where are they going? Alya, we've got to stop them!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.373580455780029|" You need to chill out, Marinette. My Ladyblog has the highest number of hits ever after that Lila interview! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.113494694232941|" What's going on? I mean has this Lila girl hypnotized everyone or something?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.327518165111542|" You wouldn't be a little jealous, Marinette?"

"Lila"|"Adrien"|0.534173011779785|" Now we can get going on our history homework. It's so much more fun doing it together, don't you think?What's that?"
"Adrien"|"Lila"|-0.624218642711639|" Uh nothing! Just stories about superheroes."
"Lila"|"Marinette"|0.699936866760254|"I love superheroes!"

"Lila"|"Adrien"|-0.674416363239288|" Ladybug!"
"Adrien"|"Lila"|0.780572652816772|"She's amazing."
"Lila"|"Adrien"|0.0322860479354858|" A girl doesn't need to wear a costume to be amazing, you know. "

"Lila"|"Adrien"|0.251444101333618|" You know I actually happen to be very close friends with Ladybug."
"Adrien"|"Lila"|-0.319303929805756|" Really?!"
"Lila"|"Adrien"|0.4320387840271|" We can chat about it if you want. Not here though. Why don't we meet at the park after school and I'll tell you everything."
"Adrien"|"Lila"|0.308966159820557|"I gotta go! I've got a lesson in 58 seconds. "
"Lila"|"Adrien"|0.62404465675354|" So, the park? "
"Adrien"|"Lila"|0.381847739219666|" Uh sure! "
"Lila"|"Tikki"|0.465222239494324|"A vixen superheroine? Hmm, interesting... "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.288361608982086|" I know. I gotta talk to Adrien before he meets up with Lila in the park. He needs to know that she's a total thief."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.353203058242798|" No! You can't say anything to Adrien yet. I need a chance to check out the book first. If it's the one I think it is we have to get our hands on it!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.0733863115310669|" I don't get it? Exactly why would we need it?"
"Tikki"|"Lila"|-0.48620218038559|" I'll explain to you once I know for sure. Please, we mustn't let Lila out of our sight!"
"Lila"|"Marinette"|-0.0664982795715332|"Ladybug and me, we're like this!"

"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.313398241996765|" Hey! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.784159243106842|" She dumped the book in the trash bin! What a brat!"

"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.651806801557541|" No Tikki!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.670261859893799|" I have to get that book! You take care of Adrien."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.467220723628998|" Tikki! "
"Adrien"|"Tikki"|0.37644362449646|" So you do know Ladybug, for real?"
"Tikki"|"Lila"|0.522369265556335|"This is the book Marinette!"
"Lila"|"Adrien"|0.690709590911865|" Not only did Ladybug save my life, we've become very close friends because we have something very special in common- it's what I wanted to tell you about. I'm the descendant of a vixen superheroine myself, Volpina."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.651393890380859|" Volpina?"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.651393890380859|" Volpina?"
"Adrien"|"Lila"|0.367525339126587|" Wait a minute! I think I read about her in my book."
"Lila"|"Tikki"|0.632273077964783|"Of course she's in your book. She's one of the most important superheroes. More powerful and more celebrated than Ladybug.Between you and me Ladybug doesn't even make the top ten.My grandma gave me this necklace."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.77560019493103|" Wow she's good. Really good "
"Marinette"|" Marinette"|0.456248164176941|" You've got your book. I can't lose Adrien. Time to transform!"
" Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.203119039535522|" Tikki, spots on! Yeah!"
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|0.66670024394989|"Are you telling me this is a Miraculous?! "
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|0.31770920753479|"Well hey Lila! How's it going? Long time no see. I saw your interview on the Ladyblog, awesome job.Oh sure! I remember our instant connection when I saved your life and we've been really good friends ever since! Practically BFF's! Uh actually, when did I save your life again, Lila? I don't recall. Oh yes! Of course, now I remember. Never! And we're not friends either!Miss Show-Off here was trying to impress you and everyone around her."
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.0099601149559021|"So I guess you aren't the descendant of a superhero either?"
"Ladybug"|"Lila"|-0.633995532989502|" She's more like a super liar."
"Lila"|"Adrien"|-0.742190092802048|" How dare you?!"
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.728380680084229|" Wait! Lila!Hey, what was that all about? Uh, I mean, weren't you kinda harsh with her?"
"Ladybug"|"Adrien"|-0.636078476905823|" I...I don't put up with lies, especially when they're about me. "
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.284208536148071|"What is with you, Ladybug?"
"Ladybug"|"Lila"|-0.603094309568405|" I may have gone a bit overboard there, but at least I'm not dealing with her anymore. "
"Lila"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.446039319038391|" My chances with Adrien, gone! I hate you, Ladybug! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Hawk Moth"|0.168828964233398|"Ah...jealousy, deceit, and the desire to be a superhero. This young lady is my perfect prey.Fly, my evil little one, and akumatize her!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Lila"|0.306406617164612|"Volpina, I am Hawk Moth. I'm giving you the power of illusion, from now on, your lies will come to life. Gain Ladybug and Cat Noir's trust and convince them you're a real superhero, then betray them and bring me their Miraculous."
"Lila"|" Adrien"|0.527154922485352|" It would be my pleasure, Hawk Moth. "
" Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"
"Ladybug"|"Volpina"|-0.50611013174057|" Code Red!"
"Volpina"|"Ladybug"|0.257408857345581|" I am Volpina, the only superhero Paris needs!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.651393890380859|"Volpina?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.222328066825867|"Looks like we have a new partner."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0379191637039185|" Don't you think it's weird, this superhero just appearing out of nowhere."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.60777160525322|" Well, at least she got the job done. If she hadn't been here—"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.423587262630463|"I could have easily stopped that meteorite myself."
"Cat Noir"|"Volpina"|0.539072394371033|" Hey! Relax! I'm just saying she seems seriously awesome. "
"Volpina"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0730039477348328|" Hey guys! Glad you dropped in, I need a hand. Come on!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.528593331575394|" I can't believe it! It's Hawk Moth in the flesh! "
"Ladybug"|"Volpina"|-0.768105730414391|" He never shows up! Something big is going on. Really big!"
"Volpina"|"Cat Noir"|-0.588401913642883|" We can take him down, but it's gonna take all three of us. We better make the most of our individual talents."
"Cat Noir"|"Volpina"|0.649686813354492|" You can count on us."
"Volpina"|"Cat Noir"|0.763631105422974|" Very nice to meet you by the way Cat Noir! Cool outfit."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.651602149009705|"Why thanks! You too, Volpina."
"Ladybug"|"Volpina"|0.167198419570923|" First the meteorite, now Hawk Moth appearing both on the same day. Don't you think that's a little bit unusual?"
"Volpina"|"Ladybug"|-0.707202553749084|" Why would you say that?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.41248482465744|"I was asking Cat Noir."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.101104378700256|" I'm finding you unusual today, My Lady. Everything okay?"
"Ladybug"|"Volpina"|0.613521933555603|" I'm fine, just fine.Say Volpina, what's your Miraculous?"
"Volpina"|"Ladybug"|0.145312428474426|" My necklace."
"Ladybug"|"Volpina"|0.597922444343567|" What power does it give you?"
"Volpina"|"Ladybug"|0.375257849693298|" The power of flight and super strength.He's getting away!Ladybug, go to his left, Cat Noir, you take the right and I'll come from behind."

"Volpina"|"Cat Noir"|-0.510251641273499|"He's running right into my trap. "
"Cat Noir"|"Volpina"|0.21267306804657|" Where did he go?I'll take him!"
"Volpina"|"Ladybug"|0.691731214523315|" Good! Now for the other one."
"Ladybug"|"Volpina"|-0.473421275615692|" Where did he go?"
"Volpina"|"Ladybug"|-0.593634963035583|" I wouldn't move an inch if I were you.Don't worry Ladybug, I don't wanna be your friend. At least now you won't be able to say we don't know each other. "

"Volpina"|"Ladybug"|0.315638661384583|" You will call me Volpina!"
"Ladybug"|"Volpina"|-0.543868333101273|" You're not a superhero. You're another one of Hawk Moth's akumatized victims!"
"Volpina"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.694883823394775|" Everyone thinks I'm a superhero, including Cat Noir. So you won't be able to call me a liar anymore 'cause everyone will think you're the liar. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Volpina"|0.253074884414673|" Take Ladybug's Miraculous. Her earrings, now!"
"Volpina"|"Ladybug"|0.0775179862976074|"Before I get rid of you, you are going to give me your Miraculous."
"Ladybug"|"Volpina"|-0.712009817361832|" Never!"
"Volpina"|"Ladybug"|0.43361496925354|" Do you really think you've got a choice, Ladybug? You'll give me your Miraculous or the building goes down! "
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.698265045881271|" You wouldn't do that!Stop! "
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.244078636169434|" It's an illusion! Just like the meteorite! Just like Hawk Moth! That's your power Volpina, isn't it?! Illusion, lies. Of course!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.305589139461517|"Is Volpina with you, Cat Noir?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.597016721963882|"No! And I can't find Hawk Moth either."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.705299854278564|" Forget it. He was never there in the first place."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.469807028770447|" What do you mean? But we saw him."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0503291487693787|"That's Volpina's power. She creates illusions. The Hawk Moth we saw wasn't real."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.652714431285858|" What are you trying to say?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0525856018066406|" She's not a real superhero. She was akumatized by Hawk Moth!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.0831218957901001|" I don't get it? Why did he do it?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.757406905293465|" I think it's partly my fault. I ruined her chances with a guy she likes."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.083027720451355|" Lila?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.673004508018494|" I'm sure she's going to his house. I'll send you the address. Meet me there!"

"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.0771373510360718|" Wouldn't Cat Noir be more useful in this situation?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.220389485359192|" If Volpina's got a thing for me, I can make her see sense without Cat Noir. Maybe then she'll listen."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.608940094709396|" You really think you can take down Volpina without your super powers? Without me?"
"Adrien"|"Volpina"|-0.550786823034286|"Hide Plagg, she's coming! "
"Volpina"|"Adrien"|-0.388314068317413|" Adrien!"
"Adrien"|"Volpina"|0.392270445823669|" Hey! Who are you?"
"Volpina"|"Adrien"|0.366016268730164|" Do you remember this necklace? I didn't know how to tell you the truth, but at least this way you can see for yourself that I'm not lying. I am a superhero."
"Adrien"|"Volpina"|0.083027720451355|" Lila!"
"Volpina"|"Ladybug"|-0.396348178386688|" You can call me Volpina. I'm sorry about the scene in the park earlier today. Ladybug's jealous because she's not as powerful as me."
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|-0.532417684793472|"You'll see Ladybug isn't just a figment of your imagination, Volpina. "
"Ladybug"|"Volpina"|-0.638518810272217|" What is he doing? No time to hang around and wait any longer. "
"Volpina"|"Adrien"|-0.637644171714783|" See what I mean! She's jealous of me, of you, of us, but this time you aren't going to ruin our date Ladybug."
"Adrien"|"Ladybug"|-0.613595306873322|" Mm excuse me, but it wasn't really quite a date, per say.I mean- what I meant was it could've become one right? No need to get bent out of shape!"
"Ladybug"|"Plagg"|-0.436228811740875|"Excuse us, but I need to have a chat with super liar.You! Stop thinking your illusions are reality!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.169924557209015|" So, was I right or was I right?"
"Adrien"|"Cat Noir"|-0.302205264568329|" Come on Plagg, Claws Out!"

"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.585011601448059|" Uh...my..um...feline sixth sense. It's legendary! Oh..."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.705363065004349|" Really? You don't say! \"Adrien\"'s gone!"
"Cat Noir"|"Volpina"|-0.681113094091415|" I'm not even gonna try to get out of this."
"Volpina"|"Ladybug"|0.652303218841553|" Give me your Miraculous now or I will!"
"Ladybug"|"Volpina"|-0.325603246688843|" I thought you loved him!"
"Volpina"|"Cat Noir"|-0.571439892053604|" Not as much as seeing you two defeated!No hard feelings, right?"
"Cat Noir"|"Volpina"|-0.677683115005493|" You're bluffing. It's another illusion."
"Volpina"|"Ladybug"|-0.0355598330497742|" You wanna bet on that? "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.586760878562927|"NO!!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.572840452194214|" Don't do it, Ladybug! "

"Ladybug"|"Lila"|-0.566842943429947|" I... totally overreacted and... never should've spoken to you like that. I'm sorry."
"Lila"|"Cat Noir"|-0.657405734062195|" Forget it, Ladybug; you were right. We'll never be friends. "
"Cat Noir"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.739701330661774|" Ouch..."
"Hawk Moth"|"Ladybug"|-0.740360260009766|" She's still angry. You're not done with Volpina yet, Ladybug. You haven't seen the last of her."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.703296065330505|" There's one problem we still have to solve. Where's Adrien?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.41974949836731|" Uh...everything's been put back to normal, right? So he must be safely back at home."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.362925291061401|" I should check to make sure!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.583424031734467|" Uh... No, don't worry about it! I'll go! You're about to change back. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.382379412651062|" So are you.No arguing. I'll take care of it. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.776606410741806|" Ugh! That stubbornness... It's so...so......irresistible. "
"Ladybug"|"Ladybug"|0.347445845603943|" Adrien?Are you there?Can I come in?"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.134721040725708|"This is...Ladybug. Is everything okay?"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.605119466781616|" Uh...yeah, yeah. I had to grab a shower after all this excitement. "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.74962654709816|" Uh....oh...yeah...sure. I'm sorry. I'll be off then, huh."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.612814664840698|" Thank you!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.3800088763237|"This book could've been my connection to Adrien without my Ladybug mask for once, but I get that I'm not gonna be returning it to him."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.0393933653831482|" I'm really sorry Marinette, but its information is invaluable."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.322063088417053|" Information? But it's all written in code."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.668894648551941|" I know someone who's been looking for this for a long time. He knows how to decipher the codes."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.709661483764648|" So what exactly is so special about this book?"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.19666600227356|" It contains all the secrets of the Miraculous powers. It's sacred and extremely dangerous in the wrong hands. He needs it back."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.445474207401276|" I don't get it, Tikki. Just tell me what's going on. Please, who is he?"
"Tikki"|"Adrien"|0.741299986839294|" The Great Guardian. And I think the time has come for you to finally meet him."
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.0527063012123108|" Did you take my father's book, Plagg?"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.525363475084305|"Of course not!"

"Cat Noir"|"Tom"|0.357568621635437|" Oh! Well, perfect timing! I have to go and take him back to his mother. "
"Tom"|"Cat Noir"|0.55054497718811|" Wait!Why don’t you come have Sunday brunch with us tomorrow? "
"Cat Noir"|"Tom"|-0.611643075942993|" Uh… "
"Tom"|"Cat Noir"|0.1730877161026|" I'll make macaroons?"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.349669873714447|" How could I say no to that? Well, see you tomorrow then! "
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.767173245549202|"Ugh!"
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|0.740340232849121|"I just thought that she followed us everywhere because she's a fan of Ladybug like her friend Alya.But it turns out that she's in love with me. Do you realize it's the first time that a girl's told me she's in love with me!Tell me about it. If only Ladybug would confess her love to me like that. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.774201735854149|"This is a total disaster! "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.668032348155975|" You shouldn't have lied about your feelings, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.544251650571823|" But Tikki, he was about to figure out that I'm Ladybug!"
"Tikki"|"Tom"|0.475196361541748|" And now everyone thinks that you're in love with him. "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.0131382942199707|" Our daughter's boyfriend is coming for lunch tomorrow! Do you realize Marinette has a boyfriend?! And he's a superhero! On top of that! She'll be safe with him."
"Sabine"|"Tom"|-0.302208721637726|"Aren't you jumping the gun a little, Tom?"
"Tom"|"Sabine"|-0.657877236604691|" You're right. I can't be baking desert when I haven't even starting on the first course yet! "
"Sabine"|"Tom"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.560144782066345|" I know! I'm going to cook them a delicious sweetheart's vol-au-vent! Now, where are the candied oranges? "
"Sabine"|"Tom"|-0.688215672969818|" What I meant is Cat Noir hasn't said anything about his feelings."
"Tom"|"Plagg"|0.510756254196167|" Come on, it's obvious that he's in love with Marinette. Besides, who wouldn't love Marinette? Everyone loves Marinette! "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.399343252182007|" You finally got yourself a girlfriend! And not just any girlfriend, the daughter of the best baker in Paris! "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.0454298257827759|" Marinette in love with Cat Noir? I didn't think he was her type."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.77711546421051|" Before you know it, we'll be enjoying some warm and crispy bread to go with every piece of cheese. Our life is about to change!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.750189423561096|" Stop it, Plagg. You know I'm in love with Ladybug. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.650581926107407|" So? I don't see the problem in keeping two pots simmering on the stove.Especially when there's actually only one pot!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.143195390701294|" I have to be honest with Marinette. I'll go over there for brunch, but only to tell her the truth. "
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.578351974487305|" Are you kidding? At least please wait until after the cheese platter is served! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.655332684516907|" He's not coming. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.155073881149292|" But if he does, what are you gonna say to him?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.124612808227539|" I'm sure he's not coming. He's in love with Ladybug. He's not gonna come have brunch just for macaroons."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.703423112630844|" He's been rejected so many times by Ladybug. Maybe he's changed his mind."
"Marinette"|"Plagg"|-0.579426854848862|" Cat Noir, change his mind? Ha! I seriously doubt it. No one's as stubborn and one-track-minded as him."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.378982424736023|" Shouldn't we be at Marinette's already?"
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|-0.665076166391373|" Shh! "
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|0.0317963361740112|" Adrien, you have twenty-four minutes left to finish your lunch before it's time to review your Chinese lesson."
"Adrien"|"Nathalie"|-0.655654340982437|"Is my father too busy to have lunch with me again?"
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|0.558061003684998|" Indeed. Your next meal with your father is scheduled next Thursday between 7:30 am and 7:45 am. "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|0.117076277732849|"In that case, I think I'll have lunch in my room while studying Chinese. At least talking while I eat will feel like I have some company. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.734950542449951|" Delicious bread here we come!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.633825212717056|" I told you, Plagg, we're not having brunch there. I'm only gonna tell Marinette that she's not the one I love. Then we'll leave. "
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.289421319961548|" Aw… "
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.653194159269333|" She's gonna be so sad. How can I make this easier on her? "
"Plagg"|"Marinette"|-0.285703003406525|" You're right. Breaking her heart with flowers will be much more romantic. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.63945946097374|" I told you he won't come. "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.172114789485931|" Eh? Looks like you underestimated Cat Noir's love of macaroons! "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.607368618249893|"I don't believe it! What a glutton! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.275727033615112|" Oh no! What if this doofus has actually fallen in love with me? For what? Seconds? Is that all his love for Ladybug is worth? Just one tiny declaration of love and that's it, poof, he changes his mind?!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.55243456363678|" Uh, since you and Ladybug are the same person, he didn't exactly change his mind."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.559640258550644|"Oh no, I definitely have to tell him that I'm not really in love with him. Wait, I can't! If I tell him that I don't love him, he won't understand why I told him that I loved him in the first place! I only told him that I loved him so that he wouldn't figure out I'm Ladybug. But if he sees that I lied, then he'll also see that I did all of that so he wouldn't guess that I'm Ladybug!And he'll figure out that I'm Ladybug! "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.30734521150589|"Marinette? Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.161718428134918|"Tikki, help me! "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.367007613182068|" Voilà! "
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.806106492877007|"This is a nightmare!"
"Tom"|"Cat Noir"|0.612258911132812|" Come on, sweetie, let him in. "
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.0372875928878784|"Uh, hello, Marinette."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.603301882743835|" Uh, hello, Cat Noi— "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.362953186035156|" Welcome to our home!"
"Sabine"|"Tom"|-0.143151700496674|" Tom! Let him come up for some air, huh?"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.696099311113358|"Oops, sorry. "
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.477607488632202|" Um, how are you? "
"Cat Noir"|"Tom"|0.679600954055786|" Uh, fine. And you? "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.663797974586487|" Oh, he brought a pink rose for Marinette, she loves pink! You two already know each other so well. "
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0141112208366394|" Everyone loves pink, Dad, it doesn't mean anything."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.469751536846161|" And actually, we don't know each other that well."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.331682920455933|" He's right! It all happened so fast!"
"Tom"|"Cat Noir and Marinette"|0.659574508666992|" Love at first sight! That's even more romantic!Have a seat, kids, I'll bring out the first course. "
"Cat Noir and Marinette"|"Tom"|0.588150978088379|" I have something to tell you…"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.317907571792603|" Voilà!Sweethearts' vol-au-vent. For two, of course."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.611643075942993|" Uh… "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.703306078910828|" Tell me, Cat Noir,is being a superhero a steady profession? "
"Sabine"|"Tom"|-0.225878417491913|" Tom?"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.612575769424438|" What? "
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.276111721992493|" You're right, Dad, it's gotta be super dangerous being a superhero's girlfriend. Maybe I should rethink this."
"Tom"|"Cat Noir"|-0.206826627254486|"Of course, not sweetie.Cat Noir won't be a superhero all his life. Once he's defeated Hawk Moth,he won't need to run on the rooftops with a stick saving people.d-I know! He could work in the bakery with me!I could train you, young man. "
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.611643075942993|" Uh—"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.67274472117424|"Maybe Cat Noir doesn't want to be a baker at all."
"Cat Noir"|"Tom"|-0.578778147697449|"Uh huh."
"Tom"|"Cat Noir"|0.630996346473694|"Ah, see? He'd love to! Everyone loves bakers. "
"Cat Noir"|"Tom"|-0.611643075942993|" Uh— "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|-0.376645267009735|"The \"Dupain-Cat Noir\" Bakery. Doesn't that sound purr-fect?"
"Sabine"|"Tom"|-0.51862096786499|" Uh, Tom!"
"Tom"|"Cat Noir"|0.494121074676514|"I can already see the little kittens running around in the house. And pet hamsters.Do you like hamsters? "
"Cat Noir"|"Tom"|-0.279755294322968|" Hamsters?"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.447363615036011|" —Because my daughter loves them. What did you want to name your future hamster again, sweetie? "
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.806106492877007|"This is a nightmare. "
"Tom"|"Tom"|-0.61498835682869|" Nightmare! Right. That’s a funny name, isn't it?I'm bringing soufflé. "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.367007613182068|" Voilà! "
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.0867063999176025|" Tom, how about we let Cat Noir tell us himself what he wants. "
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.131918966770172|" Good idea, because he seems like the kind of boy who changes his mind rather quickly."
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|0.649753332138062|"Well, actually, Mr. Dupain, Mrs. Dupain-Cheng, Marinette, here's the thing. You're really nice people and this meal is delicious and by far the friendliest I've had in a long time.Marinette, you're an awesome girl, and I get that you have feelings for me. After all, I'm awesome in so many ways, even I could fall in love with myself! "
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.682203441858292|" Anyway, I'm afraid my heart belongs to someone else.Even if she keeps rejecting me.Even if she loves somebody else. I'm in love with Ladybug.I'm really sorry, Marinette. "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.497655749320984|"Oh, this is so—Uh…So sad!Oh, to think I spent all this time following you everywhere to tell you that I loved you Cat Noir!I am so miserable!No one will ever love me!I'll end up all alone with my hamster,and its name will beLoneliness!! "
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.714782238006592|"La, la, la, la, la! Ah, such a relief, Tikki. Phew! He's not in love with me. "
"Cat Noir"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.677753567695618|"Well, uh, I don't want to bother you any longer. I'm really sorry. Thanks for having me anyway. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Tom"|0.351845860481262|" Is there a more delicious recipe than a father's heart broken by his child's heartache?Fly, my dreadful akuma. An evil feast of darkness awaits you. "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|-0.625359833240509|"How can he not love Marinette?Everyone loves Marinette! "
"Sabine"|"Tom"|0.0925376415252686|"One day, Marinette will meet another boy. She'll love him with all her heart, and— "
"Tom"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.697570592164993|" He'll break it, too. Never again! I won't let anyone break my daughter's heart again! "
"Hawk Moth"|"Tom"|-0.244646966457367|"Weredad.I am Hawk Moth. I'm giving you the power to protect your daughter from anything that brings her harm. In return…"
"Tom"|"Hawk Moth"|0.624392747879028|"I'll bring you some Cat Noir pâté."
"Hawk Moth"|"Marinette"|0.727982878684998|"That, and his and Ladybug's Miraculous, would be perfect."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.291175484657288|" What is this? Tikki!"
"Tikki"|"Cat Noir"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette!"
"Cat Noir"|"Tikki"|-0.639459162950516|" I messed up.I really messed up!Marinette! "
"Tikki"|"Cat Noir"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette!"
"Cat Noir"|"Sabine"|-0.752299249172211|" I'm so sorry, this is all my fault!"
"Sabine"|"Cat Noir"|-0.615393668413162|"Of course not, Cat Noir. It's Tom. "
"Cat Noir"|"Sabine"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh? "
"Sabine"|"Cat Noir"|-0.623775810003281|"No matter how many times I tell him, he always takes things too far. "
"Cat Noir"|"Sabine"|-0.101751029491425|"I'll bring your husband back to his senses and get Marinette out of this. I promise. "
"Sabine"|"Cat Noir"|-0.350219428539276|" Shouldn't you wait for Ladybug?"
"Cat Noir"|"Sabine"|0.551292538642883|" I trust her. She always shows up at the right time. "
"Sabine"|"Cat Noir"|0.324425339698792|" You really love her, huh?"
"Cat Noir"|"Sabine"|0.188356876373291|" Yes.But, um, Marinette's seems like an awesome girl, too, you know.Don't worry. I’ll save her. "
"Sabine"|"Cat Noir"|-0.313900232315063|" I have faith in you, Cat Noir.You're a good person. Never apologize for your feelings. "
"Cat Noir"|"Sabine"|0.543825149536133|" Thank you, Mrs. Dupain-Cheng. "
"Sabine"|"Cat Noir"|0.493881225585938|" Good luck, Cat Noir."
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette! "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.551591843366623|"Tikki?Tikki? "

"Cat Noir"|"Weredad"|0.0268597602844238|" Marinette? Mr. Dupain? "
"Weredad"|"Cat Noir"|-0.609656482934952|" How dare you come back after what you've done? "
"Cat Noir"|"Weredad"|0.58264946937561|" I will always be here to save Marinette. "
"Weredad"|"Cat Noir"|0.193252444267273|" She's safe from you and all the boys who want to break her heart. "
"Cat Noir"|"Weredad"|-0.660852283239365|" I didn't mean to break her heart, sir, I swear. "
"Weredad"|"Cat Noir"|-0.378489851951599|" Then I swear that I'm about to crush your bones! "
"Cat Noir"|"Weredad"|-0.511458337306976|" Where are you, Ladybug?I'm sorry, but— ah!I can't let you do this!"
"Weredad"|"Cat Noir"|0.386537909507751|" Why not? "
"Cat Noir"|"Cat Noir"|-0.587292939424515|" Ah! "
"Cat Noir"|"Weredad"|-0.0299922227859497|" Because I have— whoa! — a damsel in distress to rescue! "
"Weredad"|"Cat Noir"|-0.490066766738892|" I forbid you to rescue her! You don't deserve to save her.From now on, no one else but I will protect her! "
"Cat Noir"|"Weredad"|0.216304421424866|" And are you planning to protect her all her life?"
"Weredad"|"Cat Noir"|-0.38458389043808|" Exactly! I’ll keep her safe from sadness, hardship, and anything else that could hurt her!"
"Cat Noir"|"Weredad"|-0.676087021827698|" You can't protect her from what hurts the most. Do you know what hurts the most?"
"Weredad"|"Cat Noir"|0.465154409408569|" My great big punches? "
"Cat Noir"|"Weredad"|-0.655516058206558|" No! What hurts the most is solitude. Believe me, I know all about it. Nothing hurts more than isolation. Having to sit alone in front of a cold meal. Is that what you want for your daughter? A lifetime of cold meals in her prison of roses? "
"Weredad"|"Marinette"|0.543944954872131|" She will never be alone!Someday, a prince will come. A prince worthy of her, daring enough to face me! Who will brave the many dangers and pick the magic rose for her! He will be worthy of taking her from my guard!"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.467220723628998|" Tikki!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.281373143196106|" This is a magic prison, Marinette. It looks like it's trying to keep me from finding you!"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.691548585891724|" Ah!There must be a way out of here! "
"Cat Noir"|"Weredad"|0.0775890350341797|" I may not be her prince, but I'm charming enough to free her. "
"Weredad"|"Cat Noir"|-0.600190788507462|" I forbid you to do so! "
"Cat Noir"|"Tikki"|-0.587292939424515|" Ah!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.30734521150589|" Marinette? Marinette?"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.664700984954834|" I'm okay! I can do it. "
"Cat Noir"|"Weredad"|-0.724170953035355|" Not being in love with her, losing my stick, won't keep me from saving her.I'll never give up. Never! "
"Weredad"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.740087449550629|" You're not worthy of my daughter. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Marinette"|0.653313398361206|"The Miraculous! Grab his ring!"
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.0442837476730347|" Gotcha!Huh? Ah!Uh oh. "
"Tom"|"Tikki"|-0.251770198345184|" What? What's going o— "
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette!"
"Marinette"|"Ladybug"|-0.554696828126907|" Tikki! Spots on! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.426864266395569|" Ha!Gotcha! Bye bye, little butterfly. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.106552243232727|" M'Lady! Whoa!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.486839413642883|" I'm coming!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.485095739364624|" No, take care of Marinette! She's somewhere around here!"
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.692445695400238|" Don't worry, I've already taken her to safety!"
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.352918267250061|"She's as wonderful as ever.Who wouldn't be in love with Ladybug?Oh, I— she also has some flaws, you know."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.308754801750183|" Not all of us know how to land on our feet. So I guess we're gonna need a little bit of luck! Lucky Charm!Do your thing, Cat Noir! "
"Cat Noir"|"Sabine"|-0.0528116226196289|" Cataclysm!Hang on! "
"Sabine"|"Tom"|-0.225878417491913|" Tom! "
"Tom"|"Cat Noir"|0.0635589361190796|" Honey! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.0728886127471924|"Pound it, m'lady. "
"Ladybug"|"Tom"|-0.119916260242462|" Pound it, Cat Noir.Miraculous Ladybug! "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette!"
"Sabine"|"Tom"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette!"
"Tom"|"Cat Noir"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette! "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette!"
"Ladybug"|"Tom, Sabine, and Cat Noir"|-0.103278040885925|" Wait! The miraculous ladybugs have repaired everything, so she must be safely back in her room. "
"Tom, Sabine, and Cat Noir"|"Tom"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette!"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.623125314712524|" Marinette! "
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.672131538391113|"Dad, I can't breathe! "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.771486103534698|" Oh, sorry. I was so scared. You were so heartbroken because of that— "
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.522737234830856|" Dad, stop!Cat Noir has every right to be in love with Ladybug.She's very lucky to have you. And just because you and I aren't in love with each other doesn't mean that we can't be friends. "
"Cat Noir"|"Marinette"|-0.666833162307739|" Really?Phew! I really didn't wanna hurt you, Marinette.You seem like such an awesome person.Even though you’re not a huge fan of mine, like I originally thought when I saw you on the roof. "
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|0.18755042552948|"What? You just thought I… was a fan of yours? "
"Cat Noir"|"Sabine"|0.555238366127014|" Well, yeah, that's what I was about to say when you jumped on me. \"Could it be that she's a fan of mine?\""
"Sabine"|"Tom"|0.0622631311416626|" You see, Tom? Your daughter is strong and can handle her own disappointments. And even if he's not in love with Marinette, Cat Noir proved himself by saving her today. "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.634497046470642|"It's true. Your courage and tenacity match those of the greatest pastry chefs. Are you sure that you don't want to learn the trade? If you bring fresh croissants to Ladybug every day, she'll surely wind up falling in love with you."
"Marinette"|"Gigantitan"|-0.217012107372284|" Dad! "
"Mr. Damocles"|"Chloé"|0.384718179702759|" Your class representative, Marinette, is going to be handing you a questionnaire to fill out regarding your study options after school."
"Chloé"|"Ms. Bustier"|-0.504281491041183|" Utterly useless! I already know what I want to be when school is over: rich, because I'm already rich. And the baker girl, well, the baker girl. Oh, just plain ridiculous! Yes, being ridiculous would be right up your alley, Marinette Dupain-Cheng! "
"Ms. Bustier"|"Mr. Damocles"|-0.508474230766296|" You know, Chloé, people are defined by their choices and what they decide to do with their lives. That's why I'm asking you to start defining yourselves by deciding what you want to do later on. It's not just about your future careers,but also what you want out of your life."
"Mr. Damocles"|"Ms. Bustier"|0.503994822502136|" If some of you aren't sure yet about what you want to do, the Paris Career Expo will be held this weekend in various locations throughout the city! You'll meet professionals who would tell you about their careers!"
"Ms. Bustier"|"Alya"|0.181381464004517|"The document that Marinette just handed you includes a map of Paris with the locations of each career booth. "
"Alya"|"Mr. Damocles"|0.55124568939209|"How about \"superhero\"? Does that count as a job? "
"Mr. Damocles"|"Plagg"|-0.682011485099792|" I would add that you should never let the context impose your costume on you. You should choose your costume yourself! Speaking of which, I, myself, would be present at the charity stand as...the Owl! Hoo-hoo! Your daily righter of wrongs!"
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.599264711141586|" Don't you wanna continue to model?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.66784656047821|" I don't think so, Plagg. I'm doing it now because my father asks me to, and I realize now I don't know what else I wanna do. I never ask myself that question."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.563119173049927|" What do you think of Cat Noir as a career?"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.319580852985382|" Well, since Ladybug keeps giving Miraculous out to other holders, one day she probably won't need me anymore."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|0.399608969688416|" Don't worry, I will always be here for you. Hey, if you want, we could even open a cheese shop together! Just imagine... \"Plagg and Cat Noir's Fromagerie\"!"
"Adrien"|"Plagg"|-0.64277520775795|" You can't eat cheese if you're trying to sell it."
"Plagg"|"Adrien"|-0.00294458866119385|" Oh, you're right. Good point. What's a job where you get to eat cheese, then?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.388320565223694|" Why don't we start by visiting the food trade booths?Come on, Plagg, it's time to think about our future! "
"Marinette"|"Pollen"|-0.488333404064178|" True, Tikki. My life is complicated. But at least one thing is simple: I know what I wanna do later! No need to go to the Paris Career Expo for that!"
"Pollen"|"Marinette"|0.0653425455093384|" What's a career, dear Guardian?"
"Marinette"|"Roaar"|0.507385492324829|" Oh- Well, it's... your job! Something really important that you do and gives meaning to your life!"
"Roaar"|"Mullo"|0.559162974357605|" Oh! So, your job is being the Guardian of the Miraculous!"
"Mullo"|"Xuppu"|-0.554921269416809|" Of course not! It's being a student!"
"Xuppu"|"Marinette"|-0.557636886835098|" Not at all! It's making presents for Adrien!"
"Marinette"|"Wayzz"|0.34883987903595|" Well-"
"Wayzz"|"Marinette"|0.602473616600037|" Or when she designed the alarm for this room! What a masterpiece!"
"Marinette"|"Fluff"|-0.151679575443268|" Sure, I love crafting but-"
"Fluff"|"Kaalki"|0.343310594558716|" Luka's the one with the guitar, right?"
"Kaalki"|"Sass"|0.633975863456726|" Her real career is being Ladybug and carve her name in history by her glorious deeds, of course!"
"Sass"|"Marinette"|0.752578616142273|" Silence, kwamis! Let's listen to the guardian. Marinette, what is the real important thing that will bring meaning to your life? "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.618457585573196|"I don't know anymore! I guess I'm not so sure of my real job should be after all!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.320957660675049|" Maybe you should go visit a few booths at the Paris Career Expo!"
"Marinette"|"Alec"|0.46806263923645|" I guess so, Tikki."
"Alec"|"André"|-0.520624190568924|" Welcome to \"You Gotta Be Kidding\"! Today, we're live at the Paris Career Expo where I'm gonna be introducing you to the most pointless jobs ever! And to start off, here's a perfect example: André, the Ice Cream Maker, the ice cream man that is never around! Let me remind you how this goes: André doesn't have a shop, no one knows where he is, it takes forever to find him, and he gets to pick a flavor of your ice cream! You've gotta be kidding, André!Give me one reason why I should bother to chase after you when I could get my choice of ice cream in any corner supermarket!"
"André"|"Alec"|0.28771448135376|" Well, people don't just come for ice cream when they find me. They come to share their love and experience of magical moments! A supermarket cannot do what I do! I am a creator of magical moments! "
"Alec"|"André"|0.504992246627808|" \"Creator of magical moments?\" You've gotta be kidding! That's not a real job! "
"André"|"André"|-0.246604681015015|" You're right, dear Alec. It's not a job, it's a career!"
"André"|"Alec"|0.388355493545532|" But you found me today! I have some ice cream just for you: lime for the sourness you show on the outside, and chocolate cinnamon for the sweet dreams that still live inside of you! One day, you too will figure out what you really want to be!"
"Alec"|"Marinette"|-0.665964215993881|"Cut! CUT! "
"Marinette"|"André"|0.472714424133301|" André, how did you know that making ice cream would be your job?"
"André"|"Marinette"|0.0166358947753906|" My dear Marinette, being an ice cream man isn't a job; I used to have a job. Every morning, I would wake up and do something I didn't like doing. The only enjoyable moment for my day was when I would come home and concoct ice cream flavors that suited my mood. Until one day, in the same way that ice cream enchanted my daily life, I wondered if my true calling would be to try and enchant other people's lives, too! That's when the truly successful career is: a blend of flavors of what you can do, what you love to do, and what you can bring to others!Strawberry and cherry for the indecisive lady, pistachio and pecan for the clear sighted young man."
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.372417807579041|" Who? What young man?"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.178997755050659|" Hello, Marinette! "
"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.417738020420074|"Luka!Actually, Luka and I are just, uh-"
"Luka"|"André"|0.491942882537842|" Buddies! We're buddies."
"André"|"Marinette"|0.490495443344116|" You don't necessarily have to be in love to enjoy your own scoop of magic. "
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.676990628242493|" Have a good day, André!"
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.655215740203857|"Have a good day!"

"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.223917126655579|" What about you, Marinette? Why are you here? Aren't you on your way to become a talented fashion designer?"
"Marinette"|"Luka"|0.25609815120697|" I don't know anymore. There's so many careers that interest me in the world of fashion, creation, decoration. You're lucky you know exactly what you wanna do."
"Luka"|"Marinette"|0.688975811004639|" I just listen to my inner voice.This is the first instrument I made myself.It took me two years. "
"Marinette"|"Alec"|0.372877240180969|" Woah!"
"Alec"|"Luka"|-0.697653859853745|" Two whole years to make one guitar when you can download an app in two seconds to your phone?Yet, another pointless job! You've gotta be kidding!"

"Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.778796181082726|" Umm... well... not-Wait, he looks sad!"
"Luka"|"Luka"|0.713490009307861|" One more reason we should go to talk to him!"
"Luka"|"Adrien"|-0.790523156523705|" Something wrong, Adrien?"
"Adrien"|"Luka"|0.110135793685913|"I just made the rounds to every stand at the Paris Career Expo and I still don't know what I wanna do. If I don't figure it out, my father will will decide for me once again."
"Luka"|"Adrien"|-0.147379279136658|"I've always felt that modelling wasn't really your true inner music."
"Adrien"|"Adrien, Luka, and Marinette"|0.0446180105209351|" I thought things would be simple this way, that I'd be content to do what my father told me to. Like you, Luka, who decided to be a musician like your father. Or like you, Marinette, you've always known you wanted to be a fashion designer. But actually..."
"Adrien, Luka, and Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.350715756416321|" It's way more complicated. "
"Luka"|"Marinette"|-0.573974758386612|" I don't wanna be a rock-star like my dad. I make music but that's not my career, it's my nature. What I want though, is for other people to be able to feel that music. That's why I wanted to be a stringed instrument maker; to make instruments so people can create emotions with them."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.534350395202637|" I feel like I always wanted to try new things. But the things I want to do, the things I forget to do, and the things that I just have to do, it's a lot, and I don't know."
"Adrien"|"Adrien and Marinette"|-0.689307510852814|" My father arranges it all for me, but when I think about what I really actually wanna do, nothing! My mind is empty!"
"Adrien and Marinette"|"Luka"|-0.724400699138641|" I'm completely lost!"
"Luka"|"Alec"|-0.180600762367249|" There's no one way to become Marinette or to become Adrien to find out who you are. You just need to learn how to listen to your inner melody.Your inner music, Marinette, at this moment, is a little bit like a brass band where... all the instruments are playing a different tune. I totally get it why you're lost.But if you listen a bit more closely, the music of your band is really beautiful. You just need some time to understand it.Your music, Adrien, sounds like it's being muffled by someone else playing a sad piano tune, but your true melody is a happy one. Pretty rock and roll, actually.You two will eventually find what's already in front of you, but you can't hear it clearly. Just let the melody flow."

"Max"|"Alya"|0.428932547569275|"A 99.56% certainty."
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.672690987586975|" So uncool, Chloé."
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.78971554338932|" Seriously lame."
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|-0.566870123147964|" Calm down. We don't want to get upset on my birthday, now, do we?Well, I think this present is wonderful.It'll be my new cosmetics bag! Then I'll be able to think of both of you every time I use it."

"Alya"|"Alix"|-0.737410306930542|" That girl is worse than Hawk Moth!"
"Alix"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.579896330833435|" At least half the city has gotten akumatized because of her!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|-0.734257757663727|" Students, please, calm down now!The classroom is not a place for insults and defamation! Marinette, would you come with me, please?"

"Miss Bustier"|"Alya"|-0.604363471269608|" Alya. I'm relying on you to make sure things don't get out of hand while we're gone."

"Hawk Moth"|"Marinette"|-0.616724729537964|" That feeling of injustice! What could be worse than being punished for someone else's wrongdoings?Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize her!"
"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.759195029735565|" But Miss Bustier, it's so not fair! It was Chloé, pulling another...Chloé! And...I'm the one who's getting in trouble?!"
"Miss Bustier"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.621486932039261|" Of course you're not in trouble, don't worry! As the class representative, I want you to set a good example for your classmates. Don't give into feelings of anger. Try to forgive Chloé instead."

"Marinette"|"Miss Bustier"|-0.687875092029572|" I don't get it... Chloé is the meanest person I've ever known."
"Miss Bustier"|"Marinette"|-0.617344260215759|" Come on... There are much worse people in Paris right now than Chloé Bourgeois. I'm sure people like Chloé are capable of great things. The problem is, they only think of themselves. They don't understand the meaning of love, and we can't force them to change. But perhaps we can show them by setting a good example. That's why Marinettes are so important in today's world; because they have a lot of love to give. I'm counting on you."

"Miss Bustier"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.67306324839592|" I am not going to listen to you! You can't force me to do evil!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Marinette"|0.08998703956604|" Who said anything about evil? There's already so much hate in the world. I want to help you unite everyone together with love, at last! Isn't that your greatest wish?"
