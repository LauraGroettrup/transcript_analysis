"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.608803868293762|" They're so in sync with each other."
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.502163767814636|"You're right. Someday I hope I'll find someone I can share everything with…like they do.But until my father starts letting me go out more often, that probably won't be happening."
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.731830596923828|"Are you sure your dad won't let you come? It's such a bummer."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.381761193275452|"You know how overprotective he is. One day he'll realize I'm not a child anymore, but we're not quite there yet. "
"Nino"|"Marinette"|0.656136512756348|" Big finish, here we go!"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.237223148345947|" You don't wanna miss this. "
"Nino"|"Nora"|0.261122941970825|"Yeah! "
"Nora"|"Alya"|-0.186432898044586|" Aw, shoot. Did I miss the ballet?"
"Alya"|"Nora"|-0.16407573223114|" Nora, is your match over already?"
"Nora"|"Alya"|-0.182318806648254|"First round: total knockout. Huh-huh-huh.As usual.I told you a hundred times not to call me Nora in front of people, little sis.The name is Anansi, like a spider."
"Alya"|"Nora"|0.0543692111968994|" Sure, I'll call you Anansi when you stop calling me 'little sis'."
"Nora"|"Alya"|0.217986702919006|" Anyway, what are you all still doing here this late? Don't you have school tomorrow?"
"Alya"|"Nora"|0.438929319381714|" We're waiting for it to get dark. It's the World Cup fireworks show tonight, remember? We're gonna watch from the Ferris wheel."
"Nora"|"Marinette"|-0.540784746408463|"Oh no! Baguette and cappie can go with cellphone boy if they want, but you're staying here.It's way too dangerous."
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.622961282730103|" But Nora—I mean, Anansi, you can't do that!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.586801618337631|" Yeah, no way dude, we're not going without Alya!"
"Alya"|"Nora"|-0.21133279800415|" Listen, I appreciate you worrying about me and all, but I'm not a little girl anymore. Besides, Mom and Dad are totally cool with it."
"Nora"|"Alya"|-0.533508867025375|" Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk, there have been way too many akumatized peeps in Paris these last few weeks. Look how many times you've been in direct danger.So you're staying home, safe and sound, period!"
"Alya"|"Nora"|-0.754140853881836|" That's so ridiculous! The twins were akumatized right here at home. "
"Nora"|"Alya"|-0.733468651771545|" Well, that would've never happened on my watch. I won't let anybody mess with my family."
"Alya"|"Adrien"|-0.136602997779846|"You mean like the other day at the square?"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.688606411218643|"What happened?"
"Marinette"|"Nora"|-0.0554611682891846|" Well… we came across a man handing out flyersNora thought the man was akumatized and wanted to turn Alya into a banana-zombie."
"Nora"|"Marinette"|-0.773438647389412|" Uh...uh...how was I supposed to know it was some stupid costume? And besides, what would happen if the Ferris wheel stopped working 'cause some akumatized dude refused to pay his fare? Once you fly-weights can actually defend yourselves like mewe'll talk about it."
"Marinette"|"Nora"|-0.601961553096771|" It doesn't matter, because Ladybug and Cat Noir would save us if there were any problems."
"Nora"|"Nino"|-0.563074946403503|" Uh-huh. And what if Mister Whiskers is catching a mouse and that Beetle's been sprayed with bug spray? What do you do then? "
"Nino"|"Nora"|0.534590482711792|" I can protect Alya if I have to."
"Nora"|"Nino"|-0.576387345790863|" Oh yeah? And how exactly are you planning to defeat the villain? A dance-off? "
"Nino"|"Nora"|-0.14518404006958|"I'd… do anything to protect Alya. "
"Nora"|"Alya"|0.0963623523712158|" Hmm, ha! Okay, Alya can go out with you guys…if… you beat me at an arm wrestle."
"Alya"|"Adrien"|-0.76210780441761|" Please, don't arm-wrestle on my account. I don't need to be protected."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|-0.722933351993561|"Nino, you don't stand a chance against Anansi; she's way too strong."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.115031003952026|"Hey, dude!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|-0.530187249183655|" Sorry, Nino; I'm sure we'll work something out."
"Marinette"|"Alya"|-0.339874744415283|" We gotta go, or else we'll miss the fireworks."
"Alya"|"Marinette and Nino"|-0.711454004049301|"Forget it; you guys go without me."
"Marinette and Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?!"
"Marinette"|"Nino and Alya"|-0.645738959312439|" No way!Okay, Nino will arm-wrestle you."
"Nino and Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.612575769424438|" What? "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.541285753250122|" Nino will prove his worth to us that he can defend Alya and every one of us, because—"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|0.257256865501404|"Marinette, what are you doing?"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|0.293315291404724|"Don't worry, I got this.Because… uhh, because love and, uh, friendship, mmm, make your muscles bulge."
"Nino"|"Adrien"|0.373223423957825|"Yeah, thanks Marinette."
"Adrien"|"Nino"|0.589290618896484|"All right! In position. Ready. Set.Go!"
"Nino"|"Nora"|-0.397783815860748|" Yaaaaa! "
"Nora"|"Alya"|0.249763011932373|" Really? Is that all you got?"
"Alya"|"Nora"|-0.751447826623917|" She's gonna rip his arm off. "
"Nora"|"Marinette"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Marinette"|"Nora"|0.0237938165664673|"Over there, an akuma! "
"Nora"|"Adrien"|-0.612575769424438|"What?!"
"Adrien"|"Marinette"|0.410277009010315|" And the winner is… Nino!"
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.701044768095016|"Oops, my bad; it was just a fly."
"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.560151398181915|" Hmm? "
"Marinette"|"Nora"|0.562982201576233|" You rock, Nino. Come on, let's go. If we leave now we'll get there just in time."
"Nora"|"Alya"|-0.804021060466766|"You're a bunch of cheaters. There's no way I could've been beaten by that fly-weight. If I hadn't been distracted, I—"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.655812293291092|" That's it, Nora! You lost the challenge, so deal with it. I've had it with your overprotective big-sis-smothering. I'm going out with my BFFs and I don't care what you think. Alya out. "
"Marinette"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.721128404140472|" Uh, see you, Nora—I mean, Anansi. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Nora"|0.403141975402832|" A big sister with the best of intentions, unappreciated and unwanted — ideal prey for my akumas.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize her broken spirit!"
"Nora"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.736381351947784|"They don't understand. They have no idea of the dangers. They're so clueless."
"Hawk Moth"|"Nora"|0.125145435333252|"Anansi, I am Hawk Moth. They didn't want your support and protection. Well, I'm giving you the power to show them just how dangerous the world really is. In return, you must defeat Ladybug and Cat Noir and bring me their Miraculous."
"Nora"|"Marinette"|0.301810741424561|" Let the match begin, Hawk Moth. "
"Marinette"|"Alya"|0.28569483757019|" Just in time! Look at that!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.445419609546661|" Wow!What's up?"
"Nino"|"Adrien"|-0.759307563304901|" Oh, ah… nothing."

"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.717013388872147|"I don't see anything. Maybe it was a bird."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.62494033575058|"Dude, please don't tell me we're gonna be stuck up here!"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.468942582607269|"I thought you said you were going to protect us."
"Marinette"|"Nino"|-0.672721058130264|"Over there!A supervillain! "
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.671898901462555|"Uh, may-maybe you shouldn't film her, Alya. You don't wanna attract her over here."
"Alya"|"Adrien"|0.41620659828186|" A new scoop for the Ladyblog. Ladybug and Cat Noir should be showing up any minute."
"Adrien"|"Adrien"|-0.744300752878189|"Uh… uh… I think my wifi is losing signal.My friends are in danger."
"Adrien"|"Anansi"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"

"Anansi"|"Cat Noir"|-0.427847564220428|" Nora's not here to protect you anymore. I am Anansi, super-spider. "
"Cat Noir"|"Anansi"|-0.723502576351166|"All those arms, that's convenient, but you destroyed my scratching post."
"Anansi"|"Alya"|0.44926655292511|" Need a hand, kitty cat? "
"Alya"|"Anansi"|-0.58487468957901|"Nora… no!"
"Anansi"|"Anansi"|-0.724758744239807|" You're no match for me, kitten.Go fetch the Ferris wheel."
"Anansi"|"Nino"|-0.425474762916565|" Now that you can't cheat anymore, cappie, show us just how you plan to protect your friends.Come and get her if you're not a fly-weight!"

"Nino"|"Marinette"|-0.490321397781372|"I'm not a fly-weight and I don't need your help to prove it! "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.638372927904129|"Tikki, I think I messed up; we've gotta stop Nino...and save Alya!"
"Marinette"|"Female civilian"|-0.499254763126373|"Tikki, spots on! Ah!"
"Female civilian"|"Ladybug"|0.554375052452087|" Thank you, Cat Noir."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.24738085269928|" You do pretty well without me, I see."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|0.350592374801636|" Yup, but it's so much nicer when you're here, M'Lady."
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.416139006614685|" Let's go show that spider what two superheroes are capable of! Ha!"
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.557039171457291|" Alya! "
"Alya"|"Anansi"|-0.697360277175903|" Nino, don't stick around."
"Anansi"|"Nino"|0.543481349945068|" Well, well, well. Look who it is."
"Nino"|"Anansi"|-0.41607654094696|"Anansi! You let Alya go right now! "
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.755547508597374|" Oh yeah?And how exactly is a weak little fly-weight gonna force me to release my prisoner?"
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|-0.540147364139557|" Watch out! You need to leave this to the professionals. "
"Nino"|"Anansi"|-0.522705465555191|"This isn't over, spider!"
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.374748945236206|"So it's two versus one now? Fine with me! Round two… fight! "
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.624045819044113|" Cat Noir! "
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.00285071134567261|" On the floor already? We just started! "
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.244829058647156|" Are you okay? "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.695149570703506|" Everything except my pride."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|0.0695226192474365|" The Akuma must be in her headgear."
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.647841691970825|" Yeah, but she's so strong we can't even get near her."
"Ladybug"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0307692289352417|" Okay, change of plan. I take care of Anansi, you release the prisoner; it'll distract her enough to drop her guard."
"Cat Noir"|"Anansi"|0.00671482086181641|" Look out! "
"Anansi"|"Cat Noir"|0.0555521249771118|"Ding, ding, ding, bell's ringin'! Round three. FIGHT! "
"Cat Noir"|"Anansi"|-0.506770074367523|" Huh? Seriously?Oh… uh… M'Lady? I think I got myself into a sticky situation."
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.207356572151184|" Looks like I've already got a catch. You'll be next, beetle."
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.635005086660385|" I don't think so! "
"Anansi"|"Cat Noir"|-0.65524822473526|"You're like a cat caught in a spider's web."
"Cat Noir"|"Anansi"|-0.631847620010376|" Technically speaking, spiders don't actually eat cats."
"Anansi"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.392029345035553|" I suggest we make an exception for you, kitty cat."
"Hawk Moth"|"Nino"|0.385807037353516|"Anansi, grab his Miraculous from him."
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|-0.251872420310974|" Are you okay, dude—uh, I mean, Ladybug?"
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.0494095087051392|" Yeah, but we're gonna need some help! square candle appears) A candle?Of course! But I don't have enough time to do a round trip."
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|0.0245379209518433|" Maybe I could help you?Uh, I get it. It's cool. I'm no superhero. I'd tried to save Alya, but… guess I'm not strong enough."
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|-0.216324090957642|" Let me tell you a secret, uh… "
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|0.0435789823532104|" Nino. The name's Nino."
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.335753977298737|" Nino. When you're facing a supervillain, strength doesn't make a difference. Courage and determination do.We can't let Anansi get Cat Noir's Miraculous. Use this to defend yourself and distract her. I won't be long. "
"Anansi"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.394571483135223|" Where did you hide your earrings, kitty cat?"
"Hawk Moth"|"Anansi"|0.503695845603943|"Anansi, the earrings are Ladybug's Miraculous!Ugh, Cat Noir's magic jewel is a ring!"
"Anansi"|"Nino"|-0.517629832029343|" Why didn't you just say so?"
"Nino"|"Anansi"|-0.149621069431305|" Hey arachnid!"
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|0.0189969539642334|" Ah, so you're back, cappie?"
"Ladybug"|"Marinette"|-0.00975722074508667|"I trust you, Nino. "
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.0250940322875977|"Master, Nino won't hold off Anansi for long. She's about to get a hold of Cat Noir's Miraculous!"
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.624267935752869|" We can't let that happen.Marinette Dupain-Cheng, pick an ally you can trust to fight alongside you on this mission. Choose wisely; such power's on hand to serve a greater good. Once the mission is over, you must retrieve the Miraculous from them."
"Marinette"|"Master Fu"|0.742731809616089|"I need a protective Miraculous.That's the one I need, Master!Uh, if it's okay with you."
"Master Fu"|"Marinette"|0.537834525108337|"Do you have someone in mind, Marinette? "
"Marinette"|"Anansi"|0.615607261657715|"Actually, I think I found just the right person."
"Anansi"|"Cat Noir"|-0.616876244544983|"Wow, be careful. What are you trying to do with that little stick?"
"Cat Noir"|"Anansi"|-0.380772888660431|"On your left; no, on your right. No, the other right!"
"Anansi"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.75652115046978|"You're gonna hurt yourself."
"Hawk Moth"|"Alya"|0.247276306152344|"Anansi, enough toying with your prey. Concentrate on seizing Cat Noir's Miraculous!"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.533140927553177|" Nino!"
"Nino"|"Anansi"|0.0973314046859741|" So, who's the fly-weight now, huh?"
"Anansi"|"Nino"|-0.673180609941483|" All right, big boy.I suggest you stay down, cappie.You're gonna regret this, big time!"
"Nino"|"Cat Noir"|-0.647211343050003|" You shouldn't have underestimated me, legs. "
"Cat Noir"|"Alya"|0.662925839424133|"Your friend's good at this."
"Alya"|"Anansi"|-0.483348071575165|" Yeah, but I sure hope Ladybug comes back before he gets bad at it."
"Anansi"|"Nino"|0.236051797866821|"Game over. Time to fly, lightweight! "
"Nino"|"Ladybug"|0.250221014022827|" Thanks, Ladydude—uh, I mean, Ladybug."

"Hawk Moth"|"Anansi"|-0.732226520776749|"No! Don't touch his ring; it's charged with destructive energy!"
"Anansi"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.345887541770935|" Hey, make up your mind, Mothy; I couldn't care less about his Miraculous. You're the one who's been nagging me about it all evening."
"Hawk Moth"|"Anansi"|-0.647469460964203|"Cat Noir has called on his power but he can't use it. Just be patient and wait for him to transform back. Then the ring will be uncharged once again and you'll be able to take it from him."
"Anansi"|"Cat Noir"|-0.0613017678260803|"Whatever, if you say so. "
"Cat Noir"|"Ladybug"|-0.114716827869415|"Hurry up, Ladybug."
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.048615574836731|"I'm gonna need your help again. Do you still wanna save your friend?"

"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.608821511268616|" Nino Lahiffe,this is the Miraculous of the turtle, which grants the power of protection. You will use it for the greater good."
"Nino"|"Wayzz"|0.125375151634216|"Whoa, dude!"
"Wayzz"|"Nino"|0.655464649200439|" Hello, my name is Wayzz."
"Nino"|"Wayzz"|0.699015021324158|" Hey little guy, what are you, a genie like in those fairy tales?"
"Wayzz"|"Ladybug"|0.313798666000366|" I am a kwami. I can't grant wishes, but I can give you super powers."
"Ladybug"|"Nino"|0.611329913139343|" Once the job is done, you must return the Miraculous to me. Can I trust you?"
"Nino"|"Wayzz"|0.420650839805603|" You bet, dudette."
"Wayzz"|"Nino"|-0.30810421705246|" Then all you have to say is: \"Wayzz, shell on!\""
"Nino"|"Carapace"|-0.110806405544281|" Wayzz, shell on!"
"Carapace"|"Ladybug"|0.047014594078064|"That's crazy!"
"Ladybug"|"Carapace"|0.215243220329285|" Stay focused! We have to hurry before Cat Noir transforms back. And we need him to save Alya. Lucky Charm! "
"Carapace"|"Ladybug"|-0.492480218410492|" Boxing gloves? You're not gonna fight Anansi directly, are you?"
"Ladybug"|"Carapace"|0.141722440719604|" Why not? It's a simple plan, but you have to protect us — me, Cat Noir and Alya.You've already proved you're capable of doing it."
"Carapace"|"Anansi"|0.450066804885864|" Hey, six-hands! Catch this! "
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.29148930311203|"Change of pet? You replaced your kitty with a turtle?"
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.542372643947601|" I love animals, but I'm not into spiders. Ha! "
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.715717285871506|" Ha! Missed me."
"Ladybug"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.335427939891815|" Did I?Anansi! I challenge you. One round. You win, you get my Miraculous. I win, you release your prisoners. What do you have to lose?In a few minutes, Cat Noir will transform back anyway."
"Hawk Moth"|"Anansi"|-0.569586485624313|"Don't listen to her; it's a trap!"
"Anansi"|"Anansi"|-0.666186690330505|" Don't worry, butterfly man, this nasty bug ain't no match for Anansi.I'll devour you, li'l nasty bug."
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|0.238476872444153|" One punch will be enough."
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.640774011611938|"You can't punch the wind. "
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.59176367521286|" It's over. "
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.3477743268013|" One punch, huh? Well, maybe if you could actually land one."
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.777465894818306|" Shut up!"
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.636194467544556|"Why, do you have trouble doing two things at the same time? "
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|0.226264834403992|"Stay still!"
"Ladybug"|"Anansi"|-0.671462833881378|"You're so weak that when you're shadow-boxing, your shadow wins!"
"Anansi"|"Ladybug"|-0.288665652275085|" Shadow THIS!You can't win this fight, so give up and give me your Miraculous!"

"Hawk Moth"|"Nino"|-0.424509942531586|" You're gaining more allies, Ladybug, but don't rush to rejoice. Soon you might just be outnumbered. "
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.2352215051651|"Hey, you okay? You weren't too scared, were you?"
"Alya"|"Nino"|-0.548266589641571|" I'm fine. I saw that you tried to save me."
"Nino"|"Alya"|-0.188013672828674|" Uhm. Actually… no, I didn't do much. It's not like I'm a superhero or anything. "
"Alya"|"Nora"|0.678027868270874|"I know perfectly well what you're like."
"Nora"|"Marinette"|-0.779224410653114|" Fly-weights!Truth is…I did lose the match…and my cool. Sorry about everything that went down."

"Nora"|"Marinette"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?"
"Marinette"|"Nora"|-0.578258663415909|" I helped Nino to win by distracting you. I'm sorry."
"Nora"|"Alya"|-0.0457308292388916|" Hey! We're cool, Marinette.It's no big deal.Cappie proved that he doesn't need muscles to be strong."
"Alya"|"Nino"|0.647557735443115|"Want a scoop? You're the best."
"Nino"|"Alya"|0.54793381690979|" What if Nora came with us to the ice rink next weekend? It'd be more fun with her, don't you think?"
"Alya"|"Marinette"|-0.318108260631561|" You're right, Nino. Besides, I don't even remember the last time I hung out with my big sis."

"Trailer"|"Thomas"|0.599827647209167|" Cat Noir and Ladybug: two heroes facing their destiny. Coming soon to theaters."
"Thomas"|"Marinette"|0.524701714515686|" The real Cat Noir and Ladybug won't be able to make it to tonight's premiere, but I hope that they'll love my movie as much as we love them."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.505303084850311|" Meh, I'll be the judge of that."
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.552365392446518|" You turned down an invitation to the premiere?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.284074902534485|" I'm a superhero, Tikki, not a star. It's my job to protect the city, not sit around at a movie premiere."
"Tikki"|"Nadja"|0.329421043395996|" Well said, Marinette"
"Nadja"|"Marinette"|0.632955074310303|" The premiere will be attended by many illustrious guests including the rockstar Jagged Stone, the famous fashion designer Gabriel Agreste, and his teen idol son who voiced Cat Noir, Adrien Agreste."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.0105656981468201|"Adrien?! Adrien's gonna be there? Oh no! Ladybug so should have said yes."
"Tikki"|"Tom"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.483413219451904|" So we've got six hundred macarons plus eight hundred petit fours not to mention the Ladybug and Cat Noir tiered cakes."
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.453081607818604|" We should have hired someone to help us serve all these guests at the premiere."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.16698944568634|" Do you mean the premiere for the Ladybug and Cat noir animated movie?"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.299741506576538|" Yes."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.534315466880798|"Me, me, me! I can totally help you out with that. "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.272777080535889|"You mean, as a server?"
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.403466105461121|" Yes. I'll hand the macarons out to Adrien. I mean......to everybody, of course. Not just Adrien 'cause Adrien's not the only one who likes macarons."
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.285908281803131|"And the fact that Adrien is going to be there has nothing with it, of course."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.379870414733887|" Not a thing. Like, not in the slightest. I just want to help out my wonderful sweet parents who I love so much."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|-0.676538407802582|"You guys don't trust me. Then again, I'm such a klutz. Even I wouldn't trust me. "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.17226767539978|" Of course you're not a klutz, my darling. You're hired. We'll just—"
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|0.649230003356934|"Oh, thank you! You're the best parents in the world! "
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.103682994842529|" We'll just make twice the number of macarons. Just in case."
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.731003642082214|" This is going to be such an amazing night! I need something amazing to wear. And last, but definitely not least, the amazing macaron.Ta Da!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.0784673094749451|" Er, don't you think your father's 800 macarons will be plenty?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|0.549157381057739|" No, Tikki. Adrien deserves a special macaron to show him just how special he is. To me. Just picture it! He's expecting a regular macaron, but I give him this macaroon. He takes one bite and says......oh, Marinette. It's passionfruit, my favorite! How do you know me this well when I'm so secretive? So then I answer, it's because you're so special to me, Adrien. I feel like I've known you forever! So then he says to me—"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|0.109064817428589|" Wait! Is this why you bake a single macaron every Sunday?"
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.148025810718536|" Who knows when the perfect opportunity is going to come up? And Adrien cannot have a stale macaron."
"Tikki"|"Nadja"|-0.525363475084305|" Of course not."
"Nadja"|"Doorman"|0.726234674453735|" Don't be bemused, it's just the news. Nadja Chamack coming to you live from the premiere we've all been waiting for: the brand new animated movie of the adventures of Cat Noir and Ladybug. The gorgeous Laura Nightingale, who sang all the songs in the movie, has just arrived!"
"Doorman"|"Doorman"|0.794047236442566|" Good evening, Laura! I'm your biggest fan. "
"Doorman"|"Thomas"|-0.161715686321259|" This is a private event, sir."
"Thomas"|"Doorman"|0.113302111625671|" Huh? Excuse me? I'm Thomas Astruc, the movie director. "
"Doorman"|"Thomas"|0.207327485084534|" You filmed Cat Noir and Ladybug? What are they like in real life?"
"Thomas"|"Doorman"|-0.600227266550064|" Er, it's an animated movie. It's all cartoon characters. We don't actually film anyone. See, there's this whole team that draw the chara—"
"Doorman"|"Tom"|0.300286531448364|" Whatever. Who would want to see Ladybug and Cat Noir as cartoon characters? "
"Tom"|"Marinette"|0.355743288993835|" So put your thumbs here and look straight ahead."
"Marinette"|"Sabine"|-0.688351988792419|" Uh, shouldn't there be macarons on the tray?"
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|0.714450597763062|" Yes, yes. We'll put them on as soon as you're ready."
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.500061631202698|" Dad, Mom! I am totally ready. Trust me, I'll be super-duper careful."
"Tom"|"Jagged"|0.233063697814941|"Oh, our little girl's spreading her wings."
"Jagged"|"Thomas"|0.734377503395081|" Ladybug is one of my best buds! I can't wait to see her movie!"
"Thomas"|"Jagged"|0.435585141181946|" Well I'm— I'm the director, so actually it's more my movie, so to speak."
"Jagged"|"Thomas"|0.110408067703247|" Oh, so you're the one who created the story?"
"Thomas"|"Jagged"|0.150803565979004|" Well, technically the screen writers wrote the story, inspired by Ladybug's exploits."
"Jagged"|"Thomas"|-0.137076914310455|" Oh, ok. So you did all the drawings?"
"Thomas"|"Jagged"|-0.472750902175903|" No, no. The animators do all the drawings."
"Jagged"|"Thomas"|-0.0987368226051331|" So what do you do then?"
"Thomas"|"Jagged"|-0.0249263048171997|" Well I—"
"Jagged"|"Thomas"|0.641091823577881|" Woah. Hey Marinette! Now she can draw! She does it all herself. Just check out these groovy sunglasses here she made!"
"Thomas"|"Jagged"|0.55144739151001|" Well, that's impressive."
"Jagged"|"Marinette"|0.618563175201416|" She even designed my album cover! "
"Marinette"|"Tom"|0.0294973850250244|"Er, thanks. Er, macarons? "
"Tom"|"Sabine"|0.589520692825317|" Phew. So far so good."
"Sabine"|"Sabine"|-0.249290764331818|" "
"Sabine"|"Marinette"|-0.191101670265198|" Uh-oh. She's seen him."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.38580995798111|"Adrien, you're so normal to me. No, special to me. Oh, I'll never get it right."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.586760878562927|" No!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.586760878562927|" No!"
"Chloé"|"Thomas"|0.241576313972473|"You! Go fetch me a chocolate macaron, but make sure it's dark chocolate, not milk chocolate. Got that?"
"Thomas"|"Chloé"|-0.509373068809509|" But I'm not a waiter. I'm the movie director."
"Chloé"|"Thomas"|0.0791382789611816|" Oh, really? So you're the one responsible for this movie?"
"Thomas"|"Chloé"|0.448638796806335|" Yes, yes! Exactly! That's me!"
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.712385147809982|" Then you were the one who left Queen Bee out of the trailer. You're lame, utterly lame. "
"Chloé"|"Thomas"|-0.156554460525513|" And what were you thinking hiring Dupain-Cheng as a waitress?"
"Thomas"|"Chloé"|-0.762578815221786|" I didn't hire her!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.104393362998962|"Actually, it's a really good thing you're doing the serving, Dupain-Cheng, because that means while I'm watching the movie with Adrien, you'll be washing dishes! "
"Marinette"|"Nathalie"|-0.656309098005295|" Excuse me. Sorry! Excuse me. Sorry! Excuse me. "
"Nathalie"|"Marinette"|0.0893939733505249|" Adrien, you're expected to welcome the Tsurugis."
"Marinette"|"Chloé and Marinette in unison"|-0.587292939424515|"Ah! "
"Chloé and Marinette in unison"|"Marinette"|-0.688043981790543|"Oh no! Not her! Huh? Stop it! You're copying me! Quit it! No, you quit it! "
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.611145973205566|" Do you know her?"
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|-0.682922005653381|"I don't just know her, I despise her."
"Chloé"|"Kagami"|-0.309714376926422|"What do you think you're doing sitting next to my Adrikins?That's my seat. "
"Kagami"|"Adrien"|-0.657412499189377|"Don't ever touch me again. Don't ever speak to me again. Don't ever look at me again."
"Adrien"|"Mrs. Tsurugi"|-0.487415969371796|" Kon ban wa Tsurugi-sanDozo yoroshiku onegaishimasu"
"Mrs. Tsurugi"|"Gabriel"|0.697748899459839|" Gabriel-san. Per our discussion at our last meeting, I've brought these documents."
"Gabriel"|"Nathalie"|0.25822901725769|" Domo arigato, Tsurugi-san. "
"Nathalie"|"Adrien"|0.628999710083008|" Please follow me. "
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|0.612024188041687|" I'm glad to see you again, Kagami!"
"Kagami"|"Chloé"|-0.0485082864761353|" Me too, Adrien. "
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.443322896957397|"Okay. We need a plan."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.0303782224655151|" What do you mean, a plan?"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.386680543422699|"A plan! You know, a seat chart of the theater!I don't believe this! Adrien and Kagami are going to be sitting next to each other while I'm two rows behind!? Utterly ridiculous!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.477936863899231|" Yeah, well, I don't even have a seat so—"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.222084045410156|" If we get rid of Kagami before the movie starts, there'll be an extra seat for you."
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.65155041217804|" We can't do that!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.568005681037903|" Remember what you said to me once, Marinette? All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good people do nothing.Well today, the evil is her and the good people are us!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.0275588631629944|" I'm not too sure about this."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.0765095949172974|" Fine! Keep on not being sure about it and tomorrow, Adrien and Kagami will be on a plane headed for Japan!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.647607415914536|" Adrien? Japan? There's no way!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.0811540484428406|" You think? They're already going to the movies together, their parents are signing papers together. "
"Marinette"|"Tikki"|-0.626495063304901|"We can't let her do that!"
"Tikki"|"Marinette"|-0.485058844089508|" Marinette! Surely you're not gonna team up with Chloé?!"
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|-0.172953724861145|" I'm just stopping Kagami from kidnapping Adrien and taking him off to Japan. He's too nice to see what she's really up to!"
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.221539378166199|" Well I'm more of a dog person... "
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.290762305259705|" Alright.Garbage bag, ladle and what?I asked you to get some rope!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.630054116249084|" All I could find was this cooking string. You know, for tying up roasts."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.432604908943176|" Do I look like someone who knows anything about cooking roasts? "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.0561403036117554|" Hey, wait!"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.600208699703217|" Chloé! We can't do this!"
"Chloé"|"Chloé"|0.014269232749939|" Listen, Marinette! If we don't sacrifice a few macarons now Adrien is going to be eating sushi for the rest of his life!"
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.726709425449371|" You better not screw this up, Dupain-Cheng."
"Marinette"|"Thomas"|0.578547358512878|"I'm doing this for you, Adrien."
"Thomas"|"Children"|0.372877240180969|" Woah!"
"Children"|"Thomas"|-0.349401533603668|" Ladybug! Where's Ladybug?"
"Thomas"|"Teacher"|0.297682166099548|" Hey, kids!"
"Teacher"|"Children"|0.233181357383728|" Ladybug isn't here children. We came here to meet the director of the movie."
"Children"|"Chloé"|-0.289421319961548|" Aw."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|0.254966378211975|"Hold this for me."
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|0.436612725257874|" Thank you, Adrien! "
"Marinette"|"Adrien"|0.687168002128601|" Here, Adrien. This is, uh, your favorite flavored macaron. Er, of course I'm just guessing. I mean, how would I know, right?But people do sometimes prefer some things to other things so... Here!"
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|-0.1335289478302|" Uh… thanks, Marinette!"
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|-0.718839526176453|" What were you doing with that macaron? That was not part of the plan!"
"Adrien"|"Kagami"|-0.738303571939468|" Kagami is something wrong?"
"Kagami"|"Chloé"|0.733683466911316|" These shoes belonged to my grandmother."
"Chloé"|"Adrien"|0.32807719707489|" Hah! This is a part of the plan."
"Adrien"|"Chloé"|0.217870116233826|" Sit down. I'll help you."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.502513110637665|" Phase two, Dupain-Cheng."
"Marinette"|"Mrs. Tsurugi"|0.617176175117493|" Can you please autograph this for me, Jagged? "
"Mrs. Tsurugi"|"Child"|-0.518932223320007|" Kagami! "
"Child"|"Thomas"|-0.65788322687149|" But if you didn't make the story or the drawings, then you didn't do anything."
"Thomas"|"Children"|-0.389339029788971|" What's happening?"
"Children"|"Thomas"|-0.762886315584183|" Eww!"
"Thomas"|"Tom"|-0.624605774879456|" This macaron contains almonds!I specifically told you that I'm allergic to almonds!"
"Tom"|"Marinette"|-0.548312813043594|" We were so careful about that. All the macarons are made from coconut."
"Marinette"|"Thomas"|-0.470000028610229|" Uh, oh. All but one!"
"Thomas"|"Marinette"|-0.0638545751571655|" What? What in the- Who put this cake on this seat!?"
"Marinette"|"Thomas"|-0.686483949422836|" I should have known! How could one of Chloé's plans end in anything but disaster?"
"Thomas"|"Sabine"|-0.755519732832909|" I spent three years of my life working day in day out for this! What was meant to be my night is ruined! "
"Sabine"|"Thomas"|0.427397966384888|" I'll take those, Tom. "
"Thomas"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.674990773200989|" Oh, nobody could care less about me. "
"Hawk Moth"|"Hawk Moth"|-0.516586750745773|" Ah! The behind-the-scenes creator who never gets any of the credit. The perfect type of injustice for my akumas.Fly away, creature of the dark and evilize his broken heart!"
"Hawk Moth"|"Thomas"|0.757233023643494|"Animaestro. You're going to show everyone who you really are with a power as limitless as your imagination. All I ask in return are Cat Noir and Ladybug's miraculous."
"Thomas"|"Mrs. Tsurugi"|0.676116228103638|" I want them all to see what a director is capable of! "
"Mrs. Tsurugi"|"Marinette"|0.661439299583435|" Now I understand why Kagami speaks so much about you. Your father has raised you to be a refined young man! "
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|-0.6419358253479|" The plan is a total disaster! Adrien and Kagami are even closer now than they were before."
"Chloé"|"Marinette"|-0.769261479377747|" You ruined EVERYTHING, Dupain-Cheng. What was it with that macaron, anyway?"
"Marinette"|"Chloé"|0.522523760795593|" Er. It was a special passion fruit macaron."
"Chloé"|"Doorman"|-0.278181374073029|" But that's the favorite of... No. Don't tell me that!You've got a crush on ADRIEN!That is ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous. You're a nobody in his eyes and you'll always be a nobody. Watch, I'll prove it.Adrikins!"
"Doorman"|"Animaestro"|-0.656676292419434|"Who are you? You can't come- wah!"
"Animaestro"|"Chloé"|-0.277543783187866|" So you really think a director does nothing? Let me show you exactly what I'm capable of."
"Chloé"|"Animaestro"|-0.552448451519012|" Come on! Get a grip! Hey, Adrikins. You'll never guess- "
"Animaestro"|"Animaestro"|-0.667879819869995|" Oh, come on! Don't leave! The show's just getting started!"
"Animaestro"|"Marinette"|-0.45095556974411|" Roar! "
"Marinette"|"Marinette"|-0.543322086334229|" I promise I'll never take Chloé's advice again!"
"Marinette"|"Cat Noir"|-0.203119039535522|" Tikki, spots on! Yeah!"
"Cat Noir"|"Animaestro"|-0.639442890882492|" We'd have come to your movie premiere if we'd have known how upset you were gonna get."
