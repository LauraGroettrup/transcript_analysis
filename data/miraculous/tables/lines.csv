"Marinette"|0.549157381057739|" No, Tikki. Adrien deserves a special macaron to show him just how special he is. To me. Just picture it! He's expecting a regular macaron, but I give him this macaroon. He takes one bite and says......oh, Marinette. It's passionfruit, my favorite! How do you know me this well when I'm so secretive? So then I answer, it's because you're so special to me, Adrien. I feel like I've known you forever! So then he says to me—"|3|56|"Animaestro"
"Tikki"|0.109064817428589|" Wait! Is this why you bake a single macaron every Sunday?"|3|56|"Animaestro"
"Marinette"|-0.148025810718536|" Who knows when the perfect opportunity is going to come up? And Adrien cannot have a stale macaron."|3|56|"Animaestro"

"Thomas"|-0.600227266550064|" Er, it's an animated movie. It's all cartoon characters. We don't actually film anyone. See, there's this whole team that draw the chara—"|3|56|"Animaestro"

"Jagged"|0.110408067703247|" Oh, so you're the one who created the story?"|3|56|"Animaestro"
"Thomas"|0.150803565979004|" Well, technically the screen writers wrote the story, inspired by Ladybug's exploits."|3|56|"Animaestro"
"Jagged"|-0.137076914310455|" Oh, ok. So you did all the drawings?"|3|56|"Animaestro"
"Thomas"|-0.472750902175903|" No, no. The animators do all the drawings."|3|56|"Animaestro"

"Thomas"|-0.762578815221786|" I didn't hire her!"|3|56|"Animaestro"
"Chloé"|-0.104393362998962|"Actually, it's a really good thing you're doing the serving, Dupain-Cheng, because that means while I'm watching the movie with Adrien, you'll be washing dishes! "|3|56|"Animaestro"

"Cat Noir"|-0.185516476631165|" We need to put them all back in their cages!"|1|16|"Animan"

"Ladybug"|-0.68339478969574|" There are too many of them! We can't capture them all."|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.258883893489838|" Well, what are we gonna do then?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.287631213665009|" Back to Plan A. If we can destroy his bracelet, I can capture the akuma. Everything will go back to normal!"|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|0.521494388580322|" Sounds like a good idea!"|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.423480212688446|" But... it's never been broken before!"|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.652680575847626|" He didn't actually break it. "|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.583982884883881|" Then how did he get away?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.27669233083725|" I don't know, but we better find Kim... I mean, that Boy, before he does. "|1|16|"Animan"

"Ladybug"|-0.249290764331818|" "|1|16|"Animan"
"Animan"|-0.160787582397461|" It's down to just the two of us, Kiddo.And then there was one. "|1|16|"Animan"

"Kim"|0.12172257900238|" Help! Rescue me! Please!"|1|16|"Animan"
"Tom"|-0.376152336597443|" It's okay, son. Come this way. Easy."|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.635160028934479|" He's safe inside this building. Panthers can't open doors, so it won't get inside."|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.536489307880402|" Panthers can't, but what if he morphs into a smaller animal? Like a mouse, or..."|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|0.0462757349014282|" Right. But we do have an advantage over him. We know exactly where to find his prey."|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|0.243962168693542|" Animan will sniff him out sooner or later, but it's bought us a bit of time to plan our next move."|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.694677621126175|" We have to stop Animan before Paris turns into a Jungle."|1|16|"Animan"

"Kim"|0.554346323013306|" Sure. "|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.240507006645203|" Come on, Cat Noir. Make sure you lock all the doors and windows."|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|0.2863529920578|" We'll take care of the rest. You won't be in danger."|1|16|"Animan"

"Tom"|0.0582213401794434|" You're welcome, Ladybug."|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|0.598243832588196|" Et voila."|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.205882787704468|" Whoa! What's that stuff?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.0838778614997864|" Air freshener! It'll cover up our scent so he can't smell us."|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|0.678954482078552|"Thanks.I've always wanted to smell like... Ocean summer breeze?Couldn't we capture him inside something like this?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.340918838977814|" Only if he transforms into something bigger.Would that make a big enough cage?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.0842664837837219|" Definitely. But how could we get him inside there?He's coming."|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|0.352738261222839|" It's working. He's sniffing out Kim!Follow me."|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|0.450244307518005|" A Ladybug? Smart choice. "|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.216441988945007|" Couldn't he choose a slower-moving animal?!"|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.754692271351814|" Where's the button for the doors?Of course nothing works! No keys!"|1|16|"Animan"
"Hawk Moth"|0.441041350364685|" Take his Miraculous... The ring! The ring!"|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.615858763456345|" All these transformations seem to be tiring him out."|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.362568438053131|" Then just let him wear himself out. It'll make it easier to capture his akuma. Cataclysm! "|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.422343134880066|" It's not exactly a cage, but... it'll do. "|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.724749237298965|" I don't think he can bear to listen to that noise."|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.661911606788635|" You around is too much to bear. Now we wait."|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|0.232904672622681|" Ready to free the akuma?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|0.420340538024902|" It's working!"|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.360290765762329|" Hey! Since when do extinct animals count?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.632111430168152|" The T-Rex might have disappeared a long time ago, but technically it's.. still an animal. "|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.496599972248077|" Well, I know some other animals that will soon be extinct... The cat and the ladybug! "|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|0.669832587242126|" Lucky Charm!Huh? A car jack?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.688080132007599|" Too bad Animan doesn't have any flat tires."|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.574461072683334|" Look how small his front arms are."|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.61295285820961|" So it won't be great at basketball. What are you getting at?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.506364077329636|" You climb on top of him where he can't swipe at you, and while you're distracting him, I'll floor him!"|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|0.27212381362915|" Sounds like a good plan. I can be very distracting."|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.507984191179276|" Well, that's weird, we didn't have to use this. What does it mean?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|0.36270546913147|" Well, I guess that only means we rock as a team."|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.639948129653931|" Cat Noir, wait!I know what to do. "|1|16|"Animan"
"Cat Noir"|-0.674416363239288|" Ladybug!"|1|16|"Animan"

"Otis"|-0.656007617712021|" Oh! What happened to me?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Ladybug"|-0.590464323759079|" Everything's okay. But you should get back to the zoo and check on your animals."|1|16|"Animan"
"Hawk Moth"|-0.763278365135193|"You ruined everything, Ladybug. This is not how it was supposed to end! But I promise you, one day it will be me at the top of the food chain! And you'll be nothing! "|1|16|"Animan"
"Marinette"|-0.665715247392654|"Oh no! I forgot all about Alya! She's gonna be so mad at me!"|1|16|"Animan"
"Tikki"|-0.34939306974411|" And imagine if she knew you're the Ladybug who shut her up in a cage with Nino!"|1|16|"Animan"
"Marinette"|-0.690220206975937|" Yeah, and she'd actually kill me. Guess I'll take \mad\, huh.Listen Alya, I'm sorry about earlier. I should have never toldNino I set up a date with you. I just wasn't thinking. But I'll explain everything to him, so don't worry. Promise. Do you forgive me? "|1|16|"Animan"
"Alya"|0.223528623580933|" Thanks, Nino."|1|16|"Animan"

"Marinette"|0.299487709999084|" Uhh...What's he doing here?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Alya"|-0.662687003612518|" Ladybug locked us up together in the same cage all afternoon."|1|16|"Animan"
"Nino"|0.690120339393616|" It turns out we have lots in common. You know, Marinette, the girl I've got a crush on?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Marinette"|0.355815291404724|" Oh, yeah!"|1|16|"Animan"
"Nino"|-0.502228409051895|" Actually, it was you."|1|16|"Animan"
"Marinette"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Nino"|-0.0990959405899048|" Or that's what I thought. But after chilling with Alya that whole time..."|1|16|"Animan"
"Alya"|-0.422707140445709|"Yeah, well...we don't have to give her all the deets, do we?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Nino"|-0.60141333937645|" Oh, yeah, my bad."|1|16|"Animan"
"Alya"|-0.079596996307373|" The funniest part of it was that Nino was being totally coached by Adrien at the zoo!"|1|16|"Animan"
"Alya"|-0.481783628463745|" Yup! LOL, huh?"|1|16|"Animan"
"Nino"|0.18136727809906|" Alya tells me you've been crushing on some dude."|1|16|"Animan"

"Marinette"|0.370329618453979|" That oven you have there, it's a '72 La Pegnole, Right? It's a rare woodfired model! They only made a few hundred of them! "|3|57|"Bakerix"
"Rolland"|0.32801353931427|"How did you know that?"|3|57|"Bakerix"
"Marinette"|0.265647649765015|" My daddy- uh, um- My bready, bread history teacher taught us that."|3|57|"Bakerix"
"Rolland"|0.461180210113525|" Well, that's new.You need bread history classes to become a flour delivery person now?"|3|57|"Bakerix"
"Marinette"|-0.387388706207275|" You bet! You have to study for ten years to be a delivery person these days!"|3|57|"Bakerix"

"Marinette"|-0.366974711418152|" Really, but... is it still working? "|3|57|"Bakerix"
"Rolland"|-0.734815925359726|" Nope. Turned it on one day and poof!Stopped working."|3|57|"Bakerix"
"Marinette"|-0.691656082868576|" It probably doesn't meet cable standards anymore. We just watch everything on the Internet now."|3|57|"Bakerix"

"Marinette"|0.759755373001099|" Simple!They're sent in wave form to relay antennas, which are connected to satellites. It's awesome! You can talk, and see anyone you want, anywhere in the world."|3|57|"Bakerix"
"Rolland"|-0.680345088243484|"I don't need to speak to anyone! And besides, that's not how it's done if you want to talk to someone! Now put the sack down, and leave me alone! I've got work to do!"|3|57|"Bakerix"

"Marinette"|0.0246845483779907|" Don't worry, I know how it's done.You take the dough and fold it in half, rhythmically, pressing it flat..."|3|57|"Bakerix"
"Rolland and Marinette"|-0.643832594156265|" ...snapping it slightly- oh! Huh? "|3|57|"Bakerix"
"Marinette"|0.492071866989136|" It gives it elasticity and develops the gluten in the dough, so that it holds together well after it's been baked."|3|57|"Bakerix"
"Rolland"|-0.549801558256149|"Tch! You're just a school girl reciting a lesson. You don't really know how it's done."|3|57|"Bakerix"

"Marinette"|0.0527632236480713|" But what if it's really yummy? Have you ever tried your son's bread?"|3|57|"Bakerix"

"Marinette"|0.599491715431213|" Well, I think it's creative."|3|57|"Bakerix"
"Rolland"|-0.0891557335853577|"How? "|3|57|"Bakerix"
"Marinette"|0.345054984092712|" So, your son's a baker, then?"|3|57|"Bakerix"

"Tikki"|0.569969534873962|" A Kwagatama. A great symbol of friendship among us kwamis. We take a hair from our Miraculous holder and join it to the hairs of all the former Miraculous holders. And with them we grow a magic resin for a few months and-I know you don't wanna tell me because you don't want to hurt my feelings but it's obvious you don't like it."|2|31|"Befana"
"Marinette"|-0.630083292722702|" I'm sorry, Tikki! I-I really love your gift. It's just that Alya should already have called me by now. We're supposed to be taking her little sister to the\dentist\at four o'clock today."|2|31|"Befana"

"Marinette"|0.285486698150635|" It's a fake-out! See, Alya's gonna pretend to take me to the dentist, but she'll really be taking me to my surprise party!"|2|31|"Befana"
"Tikki"|-0.653137058019638|" What if you're wrong?"|2|31|"Befana"
"Marinette"|-0.727423369884491|" Impossible. All the signs are there, Tikki.Juleka totally jumped when I caught her holding a bicycle pump. "|2|31|"Befana"

"Marinette"|-0.308346092700958|" No, Tikki! Obviously she was planning to use the pump to blow up balloons! A surprise birthday party always has balloons! Also, yesterdayI caught Nino listening to my favourite song! "|2|31|"Befana"

"Gabriel"|0.0607250928878784|" I've heard enough. Are you sure you're practicing, Adrien?"|2|39|"Captain Hardrock"
"Adrien"|0.451044917106628|" I'm just doing the same exercises over and over again. I think I could make better progress if I could just play with other musicians. After all, music's meant to be shared with other people, don't you think? "|2|39|"Captain Hardrock"
"Gabriel"|-0.29543000459671|" We Agrestes are soloists. We're no where group members. I suggest you rehearse your piece some more. You'll play it for me again later today."|2|39|"Captain Hardrock"

"Anarka"|-0.71963819861412|" Whoa, sailor! Never place a metal object next to a compass, ya hear lass? Metal attracts the needle, just like a magnet, which is why you cant get them anywhere near each other."|2|39|"Captain Hardrock"
"Marinette"|-0.666325062513351|" I know how they feel. Maybe I'm just like this statue and Adrien's my compass. Maybe we're meant to stay away from each other forever."|2|39|"Captain Hardrock"
"Alya"|-0.257502973079681|" I think its the other way around. He's the statue and your the compass that goes crazy whenever he gets close! There'll be other chances, Marinette."|2|39|"Captain Hardrock"
"Marinette"|-0.12351381778717|" That's what you said last time, and the time before that."|2|39|"Captain Hardrock"

"Marinette"|-0.182071805000305|" Of course. Uh, but who's Luka? And where is he?"|2|39|"Captain Hardrock"
"Anarka"|0.377472043037415|" Luka's my son, you'll find him in his cabin."|2|39|"Captain Hardrock"
"Marinette"|-0.0693131685256958|"Uh!Hey, my name's Ma-ma uh Mamamarinette! Your mom sent me down here. The groove...uh... the group's waiting for you."|2|39|"Captain Hardrock"

"Luka"|-0.0207644104957581|" You're a funny girl, Marinette."|2|39|"Captain Hardrock"

"Marinette"|-0.705247551202774|" Uh, maybe we could turn the volume down a bit Captain? Then there'd be no more problem, right?"|2|39|"Captain Hardrock"
"Anarka"|-0.526586711406708|" No, out of the question. I didn't name my galleon Liberty for nothing, you know! It's a matter of principle! Haven't you ever heard of freedom of speech, Roger? This is me home! I will do as I want!"|2|39|"Captain Hardrock"

"Nino"|-0.408231258392334|" Well since she's got a hearing issue, there's no way she can sit at the back of the class, right? Which means she needed a place up in the front."|3|55|"Chameleon"

But soon you won't have any friends left at all. And trust me, I'll make sure you never get close to Adrien in class or anywhere. You seem a little less dumb than the others, so I'll give you one last chance. You are either with me or against me. You don't have to answer right away.

"Lila"|0.347112655639648|" Adrien, we'll have to figure when you're gonna help me catch up on all the schoolwork I missed. I also heard you play piano, my uncle's the great pianist Chuch Boroughchuck. He wanted to teach me when I was little, but I had to stop playing because of arthritis. But when my wrist gets better, I'd love for you to give me some lessons."|3|55|"Chameleon"

"Tikki"|-0.621938318014145|" You can resist it, Marinette. Hawk Moth's power only effects people who think there's no solution to their problems, and you always find a solution."|3|55|"Chameleon"

"Marinette"|0.361435770988464|"Uh, look I can't tell you that these are the gifts I've made for Adrien's next 35 birthdays.

I can't tell you I'm one of Santa Claus Claus's elves on a secret mission and that I'm looking after one of his boxes of gifts. You wouldn't be interested though because gifts are for babies, right? And you're a big kid. "|3|76|"Christmaster"
"Chris"|-0.64330717921257|" That's a lie!"|3|76|"Christmaster"

"Marinette"|-0.67077249288559|" You don't say. Well, I'm sorry, but Christmas rules are very strict. You don't open gifts early. Santa Claus gives them at Christmas, not at Easter or Halloween. Otherwise you'd might as well have a bunny or a witch delivering your presents."|3|76|"Christmaster"
"Chris"|0.353032112121582|" But, since you know him, you could ask him. Can't just you call him on the phone or send him an email?"|3|76|"Christmaster"
"Marinette"|-0.65048348903656|" Oh no, you never disturb Santa Claus Claus except at Christmas. The rest of the year he's… in the North Pole... d-of the, uh, supervising the production of toys.Besides, your present isn't here anyway. We elves don't watch over gifts for kids we know. One of the elves must have it. Santa's the only one who would know where to find it because he knows who's getting what. He has a list of good children.There is one exception to the Christmas rule.

"Marinette"|-0.59413930773735|" Santa Claus is allowed to make one exception but only for the best-behaved kid in the whole world."|3|76|"Christmaster"

"Marinette"|-0.143402814865112|" Hm, maybe Ladybug?"|3|76|"Christmaster"
"Chris"|0.228918433189392|" Well, seeing as she saved Paris a gazillion times, that makes sense. "|3|76|"Christmaster"
"Marinette"|-0.379702627658844|" Or a kid for example who cleans up all the mess he's made and plays quietly with toys that are for kids his age? "|3|76|"Christmaster"

"Marinette"|0.40488874912262|" I know, Tikki, it was pure ridiculousness. But I couldn't tell him the truth about the gifts. Besides, I simply told Chris a nice little story, which hopefully will teach him some patience.Speaking of patience, I've got an idea of what I can give Adrien for his 50th birthday!

We were supposed to go to the movies for Juleka's birthday, but now we're having a party on the houseboat and since Luka is Juleka's twin, it's also his birthday, which means he'll be there! But you thought I'd never figure that out and would end up on the houseboat with him, and since the houseboat is on the river, I'd have no way of leaving, and I'd be forced to talk to him! It's a trap!"|4|87|"Crocoduel"

"Marinette"|-0.504554957151413|" But it'll be so awkward! You know that Luka's in love with me, but I'm in love with Adrien, and every time we see each other, he just ends up getting hurt all over again because he knows I'll never feel the same."|4|87|"Crocoduel"
"Alya"|-0.642232745885849|" Overdoing it a little?"|4|87|"Crocoduel"

"Marinette"|-0.642710089683533|" I know, it's his birthday, too, but it wouldn't exactly be a great birthday if the girl who broke his heart were there, right?

"Chloé"|-0.49903017282486|" Ha! Whatever! The secret to winning in politics is ruining your opponent's reputation!"|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Marinette"|0.158351421356201|" Softer chairs, music in the library, whatever Juleka said... I'm writing down everyone's issues! Now I just have to get all this in my election speech."|1|12|"Darkblade"

"Armand"|0.195000410079956|" In the days of yore, Darkblade conquered Paris and ruled over it with an iron fist. Until he was overthrown vence by a wealthy Frenchman who used his dirty gold to buy the loyalties of the common people. To think that not so long ago, my ancestor's flag was waving above Paris..."|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Nadja"|-0.297426760196686|" Is that what you ran in the election, Mr. D'Argencourt? To seek revenge on your ancestors behalf?"|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Armand"|0.56342613697052|" Part le fer! Who dost we have hither?"|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Nadja"|-0.360583186149597|" Nadja Chamack. Don't be bemused, it's just the news! Do you have anything to say about your quote un-quote landslide defeat?"|1|12|"Darkblade"

"Nadja"|-0.627563536167145|" Mr. D'Argencourt, it has been said, and I quote, that you're \stuck in the dark ages like a stubborn old rusted battle-axe\. What do you have to say to that?"|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Armand"|-0.775750547647476|" Poisonous wretch! Darest thou approach with such venomous questions? Be gone now, pestilent pain in the neck! "|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Hawk Moth"|0.621480703353882|" Darkblade... In return for the powers I'm giving you, you'll capture Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous for me."|1|12|"Darkblade"

"Sabrina"|0.323105335235596|"Wait, I had one just like this! How about... a ball of yarn! Or a screwdriver?"|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Chloé"|-0.684311598539352|" 'Course not, dingbat! A disgusting photo of her or some really tacky piece of clothing! Dig around a bit!"|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Sabrina"|0.39537501335144|"Ohh... how about her diary?"|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Chloé"|0.426664233207703|" Wow! You can actually accomplish something when you put my mind to it!"|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Chloé"|-0.124892771244049|" Sabrina? Sabrina?!"|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|0.733190298080444|" I'm pleased to welcome you all to the official launch of Chloé's electoral campaign. And a special thank-you to world-famous pop-star Jagged Stone for endorsing her."|1|12|"Darkblade"

"Sabrina"|0.121094107627869|" I did! Sorta... "|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Chloé"|-0.107019484043121|"What is that?"|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Sabrina"|-0.37565404176712|" When I grabbed the diary, this crazy box clipped down around my hand!"|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Chloé"|-0.623015850782394|" And I'm supposed to believe you? Ughhh... Why do I bother?"|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Marinette"|-0.703391522169113|" Do you realize that you're all being bribed? Concert tickets are awesome, but they aren't gonna solve classroom problems."|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Nathaniel"|0.474843502044678|" So what's your campaign then, Marinette?"|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Marinette"|0.4303297996521|" Well, um, I'm, um, thinking that cushions would be more realistic than buying new chairs.Your cushion could be very pink. And I'll see about listening to music in the library. Through headphones, of course."|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Chloé"|-0.161918938159943|"Remarkable. You actually sound like a class rep. Too bad you don't have a chance of winning. A word?"|1|12|"Darkblade"
"Marinette"|-0.138368368148804|" Oh! My diary! What were you doing-?"|1|12|"Darkblade"

"Fireman"|0.619922637939453|" Yes, in fact, if you wouldn't mind I..."|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Marinette"|-0.425387680530548|"I'm sure it was Chloé. I saw her on her phone right before the alarm went off!"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Alya"|-0.320798754692078|" You seeing her make a phone call isn't solid proof. "|2|29|"Despair Bear"

"Chloé"|-0.352040469646454|" I saw a student leaving the classroom right before the alarm went off. It must have been her."|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Chloé"|-0.418843269348145|" Let's see if she'll come clean. What do you say, Marinette Dupain-Cheng? "|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Mr. Damocles"|0.43526828289032|" Marinette, do you have something to tell the firefighter captain?"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Adrien"|-0.700515270233154|" Urgh, wait. Excuse me, sir!It couldn't possibly be Marinette. Why would she disrupt her own father's cooking class?"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Alya"|-0.429806053638458|" And I know for a fact that Marinette didn't even have her phone on her when she went out of the classroom."|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Fireman"|-0.334099888801575|" Mr. Damocles, I must be heading out."|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Mr. Damocles"|0.369479894638062|" Just one more second. We're very close to discovering the truth."|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Chloé"|-0.719387233257294|" Oh well, we all know it can't be me!"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Marinette"|-0.54147943854332|" I'm not gonna let her get away with this. I've gotta tell..."|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Adrien"|-0.281573593616486|" Hang on, Marinette. We don't know for sure it was her. "|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Alya"|-0.737202197313309|" He's right. Let's not stoop to her level."|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Fireman"|-0.161497831344604|" I really have to leave now. Just call me if you find out who the prankster is. "|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Mr. Damocles"|-0.675938576459885|" Fine. Since no one is owning up, the whole school will be punished. "|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Chloé"|-0.595561414957047|" What?! I'm not so sure my father will react kindly to me being punished without any proof! gets out her phone, preparing to call her dad"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Mr. Damocles"|-0.750248774886131|"Oh, no! Please, don't disrupt the busy mayor.The whole school is punished except for Miss Bourgeois! "|2|29|"Despair Bear"

"Marinette"|0.199505567550659|" I know. Adrien just talked in my ear!"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Alya"|-0.498490750789642|"Seriously, Marinette?"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Chloé"|-0.636916190385818|"Can't you see I'm trying to relax here? Go sweep somewhere else, Cinderella!"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Chloé"|-0.759426236152649|" Adrikins!"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Chloé"|-0.211167454719543|" Of course it was me who called the fire department. So what?"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Adrien"|-0.745892316102982|" And it doesn't bother you that everyone's being punished because of you?"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Chloé"|-0.424878180027008|" No. Why would it? They all seem to enjoy getting dirty making cookies. How's it any different than getting dirty, cleaning floors? They should be thanking me if anything. "|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Adrien"|0.503052115440369|"Chloé, how long have you and I been friends?"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Chloé"|0.458076000213623|" Since we were adorable little tots, Adrikins. "|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Adrien"|-0.701682835817337|"Well, I'm sorry Chloé, but I can't be friends with someone who treats other people like this. You've gotta be nice to people!"|2|29|"Despair Bear"

"Chloé"|-0.653338402509689|" Adrien says I have to be nice to everyone or he won't be my friend anymore! How can he do this to me, Jean-Michel?"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Jean"|0.344966650009155|" Uh, my name is... hm, never mind. Ah, perhaps Mademoiselle can see comfort with Mr. Cuddly?"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Jean"|0.675078511238098|" If you would allow it, Mademoiselle, I could help you keep your friendship with Adrien."|2|29|"Despair Bear"

"Jean"|0.622522830963135|" Because that's what being nice is all about, Mademoiselle. "|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Jean"|0.343246221542358|" I'm sure Mademoiselle can remember when she was a little girl when Mr. Cuddly was always nice to Mademoiselle when she was sad. Mr. Cuddly can teach you how to be kind to others!"|2|29|"Despair Bear"
"Chloé"|0.718814015388489|"I remember, Jean-Luc. Adrien's going to see just how nice I can be."|2|29|"Despair Bear"

"Jean"|0.667707681655884|" It's what Mr. Cuddly would do, yes."|2|29|"Despair Bear"

"Ladybug"|-0.533838093280792|" Cat Noir? Act like Shadow Moth? Wow. Are you blowing this out of proportion just a little?"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Su-Han"|-0.625653207302094|" Not at all. In fact, you should find out who Cat Noir really is, so you can have better control over him."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|-0.404989063739777|" What? No way! We can't know our true identities! It would be too dangerous if Shadow Moth got a hold of one of us!"|4|97|"Ephemeral"

"Ladybug"|-0.34035724401474|"Nevermind! We got through it. That's all that matters. But we do need to talk. Meet me at the top of the Eiffel Tower."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Cat Noir"|-0.539792746305466|"I get the feeling I'll have my whiskers yanked. "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Luka"|0.0982811450958252|" I'm wondering, Ladybug. How do you plan to reveal Cat Noir's identity to Su-Han if you don't know who he is?"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Marinette"|-0.595755696296692|" Remember why you must all ignore who Cat Noir and I really are? "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Luka"|-0.71666407585144|" So Shadow Moth leaves us alone when we're not superheroes? If we don't know who you are, we're no interest to him."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Marinette"|-0.65413236618042|" Yes. But in fact, if worse comes to worst, a Miraculous holder could know Cat Noir's identity or mine, but not both. "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Luka"|-0.195416390895844|" That way, there'd always be one of you to fight Shadow Moth!"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Marinette"|-0.405152559280396|" Exactly! But for Cat Noir and me, it's different. If we knew each other's identities, all would take is just for one of us to be akumatized to betray the other. "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Luka"|-0.0727256536483765|" And Shadow Moth would win."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Marinette"|-0.554696828126907|" Tikki, spots on! "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Luka"|-0.234572112560272|" Sass, scales slither! "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|0.437548995018005|" This is the plan: you stay here hidden. I ask Cat Noir his identity. He tells me..."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Viperion"|0.669681787490845|" Since I'll hear everything, I'll also know his name."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|-0.249420940876007|" That's when you'll use your power of Second Chance to go back in time. I'll forget everything but you won't."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Viperion"|0.4205082654953|" Or I could just ask him myself if you want. It'd be less dangerous that way, wouldn't it?"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|-0.464475154876709|"Cat Noir will only tell if I'm the one asking."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Viperion"|0.500925540924072|" Alright, and then I'll tell the Celestial Guardian Cat Noir's identity."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|0.0907291173934937|" And then he'll finally got me some slack. "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Viperion"|-0.25068336725235|" Are you sure the fact that I know who Cat Noir is won't be a problem?"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|-0.546257793903351|" Like I said, as long as I don't know who he is, everything will be fine."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Viperion"|0.317664265632629|"Do you think Cat Noir would agree to this?"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|0.686939716339111|"He's been dying to tell me who he is for the longest time.There he is! Get ready!"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|0.640762329101562|" Now! We're in sync!"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Viperion"|-0.128132224082947|" Second Chance!"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|0.253464937210083|" The countdown has begun. It's 1 am, and we've got just five minutes before you transform back. So we've got to be done by 1:05. You'll rewind on my signal."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Cat Noir"|-0.680811256170273|"I'm sorry, but I really couldn't make it earlier."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|-0.544824570417404|"Hey, no big deal! That's the good thing about a team. It's not the two of us anymore! "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Cat Noir"|0.108228325843811|" Oh, yeah! So then, why did you need me exactly?"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|0.466480851173401|" Well... actually, it's kind of linked to what happened today. I've given it a lot of thought ever since I became guardian, you know?And, I've realized that... you were right after all.We should tell each other our secret identities. "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Cat Noir"|-0.668644577264786|" But, aren't the secrets supposed to protect us?"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|-0.441717386245728|" I thought so. But when you didn't show up today, I didn't know how to locate you because we can't communicate when we're not transformed. If something bad happened to one of us when we're not heroes, we could know about it. It would make us stronger. We'd be able to defeat Shadow Moth quicker! "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Cat Noir"|0.374152660369873|"So, we're doing this, for real?"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|0.299741506576538|" Yes."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Cat Noir"|0.348522067070007|" Wow. Okay. You go ahead, m'lady. Guardians first!"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|-0.601328045129776|" No, you first. "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Cat Noir"|0.329734206199646|" Let's do it together."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|-0.599900782108307|" No, I mean it. You go first. I'm... feeling kind of... awkward. "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Cat Noir"|-0.16008049249649|" Fine. I'm... I'm... Adrien Agreste."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|0.0443140268325806|"And I'm Audrey Bourgeois!You? Adrien Agreste? There's no way! You two aren't alike at all!"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Cat Noir"|-0.454914927482605|" Claws in. "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Adrien"|0.521077513694763|" See? It's really me, Adrien Agreste. What about you?"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Viperion"|-0.0647400617599487|"Ladybug! I heard his name! Shall I rewind?"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|-0.165364146232605|" No— Wait— Not— Not yet. "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Adrien"|-0.27729731798172|"I understand. It's never easy to show your true self to someone. You'd wonder what the other person would think of you if they'll like you. It's hard for me, too, you know? My heart's beating so fast, I've waited for this moment for so long! Imagine the stories that I have come up with when you saved my life as Adrien, or when you wanted to give me another Miraculous! It was awful having to hide Cat Noir from you. I'm so glad I don't have to do that anymore! I hope you're not too disappointed. But whoever you are behind that mask, you'll always be the most amazing person in the world."|4|97|"Ephemeral"

"Luka"|-0.167602777481079|" What made you change your mind?"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|-0.242892920970917|" I... guess I'm just curious to see what's gonna happen. After that..."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Luka"|-0.519817143678665|" But you said it was too dangerous to know his identity."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Ladybug"|0.0787652730941772|" As long as Cat Noir doesn't know who I am, it'll be okay. And I'm gonna make sure of that, starting with Grand Master Su-Han."|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Tikki"|0.701956033706665|" This is wonderful! Since Cat Noir's in love with Ladybug, that means he's in love with you! You and Adrien can finally be together!"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Marinette"|0.600415587425232|"It's not that simple, Tikki. I'm in love with Adrien, but I've never been in love with Cat Noir.It's as if they are two completely different people! Is the Adrien I'm in love with the fake Adrien? Is Cat Noir the \real\ Adrien? Who's the real Adrien behind Adrien?"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Tikki"|-0.273471772670746|" I don't know. Why don't you ask Alya?"|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Marinette"|-0.612066507339478|" I can't. She already knows I'm Ladybug. She can never know that Adrien is Cat Noir. It'd be too dangerous. "|4|97|"Ephemeral"
"Adrien"|0.526979088783264|"When she's ready, she will tell me who she is! In the meantime, she'll get to know me!And then, who knows?I'm so char-meow-ing after all!"|4|97|"Ephemeral"

"Alya"|0.60633385181427|" It's like some kind of secret society emblem. As if a kind of Order of the Guardians has been watching over the superheroes since the beginning of time."|3|68|"Feast"
"Marinette"|-0.704446405172348|" It's my fault, Master. I'm sorry. I never should have entrusted her with the Miraculous."|3|68|"Feast"
"Master Fu"|0.00970172882080078|" Alya is an excellent journalist. Sooner or later, she would have unveiled this secret kept under wraps for centuries. But don't worry. None of it can lead Hawk Moth to us."|3|68|"Feast"

"Marinette"|-0.680298030376434|" Because of a statue? But just a second ago you were saying—"|3|68|"Feast"
"Master Fu"|-0.665056318044662|" That's not a statue, Marinette. It's a Peacock!"|3|68|"Feast"
"Marinette"|-0.513822257518768|" But, Master, Cat Noir and I have already defeated sentimonsters created by Mayura."|3|68|"Feast"
"Master Fu"|-0.478657722473145|" Yes, but… None of them came close to the power of this one. It was born from a negative emotion of a young man who had no idea what he was creating. Remember when I told you I made a terrible mistake? For you to understand, I must tell you the entire story.I was younger than you when I was chosen to be a guardian. My parents told me that it was a great honor. That I couldn't turn it down. So they took me to the temple. I wasn't very happy there. I would have preferred to live with my parents and be with other children my age. I didn't want to be a guardian of anything. One of the test to become a guardian required me to watch over a grimoire he managed to save, and the Miraculous Box. The very last Miraculous Box. That's when I realized my sentimonster had devoured all the other Miraculous Boxes that were kept in the temple. And when the monks tried to stop it—the temple, the Order of the Guardians, everything… it was destroyed. I tried to run away from the sentimonster. But by doing so, I lost the grimoire and both the Butterfly and the Peacock Miraculous. I thought the sentimonster had disappeared forever.As soon as Hawk Moth finds out about it, he'll be able to use the power of the Peacock to bring it back to life."|3|68|"Feast"
"Marinette"|0.601155757904053|" Master, if that happens, Cat Noir and I will be there."|3|68|"Feast"
"Master Fu"|-0.641060799360275|" But you won't stand a chance! He's totally immune to the powers of the Miraculous! And please stop calling me Master. I have never been a guardian to begin with. I will not make another mistake! You and Cat Noir will give me your Miraculous back and I'll leave Paris with the Miracle Box, since that's what the monster is after. They will come after me, sparing the city and its inhabitants."|3|68|"Feast"
"Marinette"|-0.360803544521332|" But what if it catches up with you this time?"|3|68|"Feast"
"Master Fu"|-0.608575254678726|" That will be my fate. It's all my fault, after all."|3|68|"Feast"
"Marinette"|-0.476329028606415|" I won't let you leave on your own! When you chose me to become Ladybug, you placed your trust in me. I'm asking you to do the same today."|3|68|"Feast"

"Marianne"|0.558018326759338|" Would you believe it? Wang discovered a passion for painting. "|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Wang Fu"|0.692172765731812|" Actually, as a thank you for helping me, I want to give you this painting. "|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Marinette"|0.520074844360352|" Thank you. It's... really... Uh, am I holding it the right way?"|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Wang Fu"|-0.177961587905884|"Yes. I'm not sure myself what's supposed to represent.But when I think of you, this is what I see. So, there you go.What's this?That's such a cute little doll. Is it yours? "|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Marinette"|-0.756428450345993|"Yes! It probably fell out when I took out the cake. "|4|83|"Furious Fu"

"Su-Han"|-0.228183567523956|" How come you are in possession of the Mother Box, young lady?"|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Marinette"|0.478250741958618|"Who are you? "|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Tikki"|0.598873019218445|"That's Grand Master Su-Han. The celestial guardian of the Miracle Box. "|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Marinette"|-0.159818112850189|" But I'm the guardian of the box. "|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Tikki"|-0.309422612190247|" Celestial Guardian was in charge of it before that incident caused by Master Fu. "|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Marinette"|0.593523025512695|"How did you find me?"|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Su-Han"|0.328274607658386|" The guardians' staffs hold compasses that allow the boxes to be tracked at all times. "|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Marinette"|-0.728695571422577|" Hey! That's not fair! Why didn't I get a staff?"|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Su-Han"|-0.728032171726227|" Precisely because you are not a true guardian! This is all a misunderstanding, and the incorrect shape of the box proves it."|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Marinette"|-0.286521971225739|" But I don't get it. Master Fu entrusted it to me."|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Su-Han"|-0.751174181699753|" FU?! As in Wang Fu, also known as Whiny Chicken Leg?! That incompetent disciple unable to spend one entire day without eating, or do a thousand finger push-ups?! Fu should never have been a guardian. That low-life never lived up to the hopes that were placed in him."|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Marinette"|0.348335862159729|" Master Fu may have made mistakes when he was young, but he bravely protected the box for years! He even sacrificed himself and erased his own memory to save us!And now, he's become a great painter!"|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Su-Han"|-0.777425989508629|" That old man is Whiny Chicken Leg?! Wait...Some kwamis are missing."|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Marinette"|-0.554246097803116|" When Master Fu gave the box, he already lost butterfly and the peacock. "|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Su-Han"|-0.796262100338936|"He's lost a Miraculous too?!He's even more incompetent than I thought.PLAGG! Young girl, where is Plagg?!"|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Marinette"|-0.0173652768135071|" That I know. Cat Noir is his holder."|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Su-Han"|0.120814681053162|"And who is Cat Noir?"|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Marinette"|-0.519845962524414|" Well... I don't know, since we're supposed to keep our identities secret."|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Su-Han"|-0.518335223197937|" So this is the modern world: protected by a group of careless fools. Guardians must never wear a Miraculous! Some jewels missing and Plagg roaming free?! The end of dinosaurs and dragons - doesn't that alarm anyone?!That's enough! Kwamis, get in ying-yang patterns and back inside the box. "|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Marinette"|0.0587928295135498|" What are you doing?! "|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Su-Han"|-0.0378597974777222|" Let me remind you about some of the Perfect Precepts that you have broken.Precept 14: Kwamis must not live outside the box.Precept 52: Guardians must never lose a Miraculous.Precept 133: A guardian cannot, under any circumstances, wear a Miraculous. "|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Marinette"|-0.303602933883667|" But Master Fu wore one himself!"|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Su-Han"|-0.603274077177048|" Precisely! That just proves what I've been saying all along! Neither you nor Fu were up to the role of Guardian, because neither of you have respected the ancient absolute rules of our order! Not to mention the fact that no child should be a keeper of kwamis! They are ultra-powerful cosmic entities! One must manage them with authority, which you are obviously incapable of doing! "|4|83|"Furious Fu"

"Su-Han"|-0.639213144779205|"Challenging me like this is akin to pulling on the tiger's whiskers, you villain! "|4|83|"Furious Fu"

"Su-Han"|0.322300314903259|"Such a powerful spell! How did that warrior end up in this flat prison of glass and metal?Anyway, we must waste no more time! Take me to Cat Noir, young lady."|4|83|"Furious Fu"

"Ladybug"|-0.691108167171478|" We can't do that! How are we going to defeat Shadow Moth without our Miraculous?"|4|83|"Furious Fu"
"Su-Han"|0.450695991516113|" I will reassign then to carefully selected, appropriate adult holders. Like any rightful responsible Guardian would do."|4|83|"Furious Fu"

Whiny Chicken- uh, sorry.. Master Fu may not have made such a bad choice after all.The Miracle Box is the mother of all boxes. It's the very first one that was created, and the one that holds the most powerful magic jewels. I cannot imagine what would happen if it were to fall into the wrong hands.

"Sentimonster Gabriel"|0.205619215965271|" Wherever it is, you're going to give it back to me."|4|98|"Gabriel Agreste"

"Félix"|-0.414821922779083|" This is impossible! I'm not mistaken. You are wearing a Miraculous. Those jewels are underneath your scarf, the brooches!"|4|98|"Gabriel Agreste"
"Sentimonster Gabriel"|-0.00751245021820068|" Brooches? What are you talking about?"|4|98|"Gabriel Agreste"
"Shadow Moth"|-0.209483861923218|"You really think that Gabriel Agreste could be Shadow Moth?He doesn't have what it takes! And neither do you. Accept the power I'm offering you!"|4|98|"Gabriel Agreste"

Almost too easy, no stuttering, they hold hands, they get all kissy-kissy, and then, SURPRISE! She has secrets! And him, he hates secrets, of course.

"Kagami"|-0.563159942626953|" The problem is that your technique to get Adrien to fall for you is terrible. The art of attraction is like combat, and to win in combat you need training. You are Tori, the attacker, so you need Uke, the defender."|4|95|"Glaciator 2"

"Marinette"|0.207968473434448|" That's why it's so scary to tell someone you love them. Even saving the world seems easy comparing to it. Well, I suppose it is. I mean, just look at you! When you have to save the world with Ladybug, you just bulldoze ahead, you don't think about it! A couple of jokes, and bam! Cataclysm, Lucky Charm, Miraculous Ladybug!

I tell myself stories with wedding dresses, and hamsters, and what people see is not Marinette opening her heart up.

"Marinette"|0.680400967597961|" Ever since I've met you, I've had three suns in my heart. They shine so brightly that whenever I see you... "|4|95|"Glaciator 2"
"Cat Noir"|-0.693344831466675|" That was a good start. What's wrong?"|4|95|"Glaciator 2"
"Marinette"|-0.179250538349152|" What's wrong is that this is not really me.The first time I saw you, I misjudged you. I thought you were conceited and superficial. But then, I got to know you. I saw who you really were deep down—someone sweet, sincere, and generous. Since then, there's something I've been wanting to tell you. But every time I try, it's like my brain suddenly freezes. But now, I think I'm ready. I love you."|4|95|"Glaciator 2"

"Kagami"|-0.440015017986298|" Good. I was worried, 'cause that's a very risky technique. When you start practicing with a Boy, you could fall in love with him, and then you might run away together to a desert island where you might get attacked by zombie carnivorous plants."|4|95|"Glaciator 2"

"Bob"|-0.273681640625|" Not bad, Jagged, not bad. But if you really want to be making something killer, let's talk about this duet with Mr. XY."|1|20|"Guitar Villain"
"Jagged"|-0.693044811487198|" No way. He's not a rocker, he's a baby! I bet he doesn't even shave yet."|1|20|"Guitar Villain"
"Bob"|-0.578030109405518|" Well, this \baby\ just pushed you out of the number one sales spot."|1|20|"Guitar Villain"
"Jagged"|-0.632452428340912|" And? Doesn't make him a true musician like me. Penny thinks everything I'm doing's rock star material. She thinks I'm killer."|1|20|"Guitar Villain"
"Bob"|-0.510271191596985|" Penny might be your agent, but I'm your real boss. Listen. Bottom line is that Bob Roth Records cannot afford to be number two in sales! Or rep a number two rock star!

"Jagged"|-0.646091103553772|" You want to talk about real? I'm a genuine rock 'n' roller, Bob, not some pop star in diapers. I'm a real artist. Real talent! Even my hair is real. And that's what people love about me.Isn't that right, Fang? Yeah.And the artwork you came up with for my album is a waste of my time! Seriously, Bob, what is this trash? It looks like a perfume ad!"|1|20|"Guitar Villain"

"Jagged"|-0.549964636564255|" Well, I don't. My album covers are raw to the bone, exuding the smell of sweat and leather!"|1|20|"Guitar Villain"
"Bob"|-0.615615218877792|" You do know, don't you, that if your next album doesn't rate #1 on the charts, it'll be the last one you ever do with Bob Roth records."|1|20|"Guitar Villain"
"Jagged"|-0.718864381313324|" I'd rather put out nothing at all than sing some pathetic duet with a baby-faced nobody."|1|20|"Guitar Villain"

"Bob"|0.614899158477783|" That's right! Requested by Jagged Stone himself.I brought a few visuals so you can get a sense of what we're going for."|1|20|"Guitar Villain"
"Marinette"|-0.132934629917145|"This doesn't seem like Jagged Stone material. More like...a perfume ad!"|1|20|"Guitar Villain"

"Marinette"|-0.743833482265472|"Oh, why does Jagged Stone want to change his style? XY's music is so cold and lifeless, repetitive, mundane, the total opposite of Jagged. And what I've just done here is...ugh...is so not my style either."|1|20|"Guitar Villain"
"Tikki"|0.110400795936584|" So why are you doing it, then?"|1|20|"Guitar Villain"

"Cat Noir"|0.27129054069519|" No, you're not Ladybug! You're Scarabella! And now that you have a cool name, you've gotta hang in there, cause that's what Ladybug would do! Besides, you have the best in partner in the world to help you.The funniest, incredible, Cat Noir! Meooow!"|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Scarabella"|-0.743961364030838|" Okay, Robostus! You've got us trapped in here surrounded and we haven't found out where you're hiding, so looks like we lost, right?"|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Robostus"|0.486045241355896|" According to my calculations, I have a 99.98% chance of victory!"|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Scarabella"|-0.460066437721252|" Hmm, so that 0.02% must be where Cat Noir cataclysms my Miraculous, then Shadow Moth won't get his hands on what's most valuable to him. And then, you won't actually have won! Am I correct?"|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Cat Noir"|0.468196988105774|" Yeah, brilliant! Cataclysm! "|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Shadow Moth"|-0.701120972633362|"Watch out, Robostus! This substitute Ladybug might not be as incompetent as she seems!"|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Robostus"|-0.349054098129272|" Are you suggesting we negotiate, human superhero?"|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Scarabella"|-0.594865620136261|" You got it! We're not giving up until you've released all people and objects you've captured. That way, I won't have completely goofed up my first and last mission. Maybe then, the real Ladybug won't be so mad at me."|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Robostus"|0.156561970710754|" Request granted. Now give up."|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Scarabella"|-0.631141602993011|" Nope. You empty your hard drive first."|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Robostus"|-0.601328045129776|" No! You first!"|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Scarabella"|0.339132785797119|" Fine. I'll hand myself over first, then you release everything you've captured."|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Cat Noir"|-0.514673918485641|" And only then will I give myself up."|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Robostus"|-0.322418391704559|"There's a 92% chance it's a trap."|4|93|"Hack-San"

"Cat Noir"|-0.544391661882401|" Nope, but you were lucky enough to have been saved by the one and only Scarabella, in person. I don't you understand how you solved all of this, but... "|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Scarabella and Cat Noir"|-0.271977782249451|" Pound it!"|4|93|"Hack-San"

"Ladybug"|-0.725937992334366|" I'm really sorry, Cat Noir. I should've told you. I mean, if I found out that you told someone about your secret identity, I'd... probably be upset, too. I'm really sorry I hurt your feelings."|4|93|"Hack-San"
"Cat Noir"|-0.678806185722351|" You didn't hurt my feelings. You did everything right. Paris will always need a Ladybug superhero to watch over her. It's just...

"Plagg"|0.485579013824463|" Because... it's a kwami power!And, since I can go and present the Miraculous to him myself, you'll never know who he is! That way, you'll have a new Cat Noir, who's not in love with you at all and everything will be perfect!"|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Marinette"|-0.451423227787018|"But... isn't it kind of risky to leave you on your own outside without a holder with your own Miraculous? What if Shadow Moth would capture you?"|4|100|"Kuro Neko"

"Adrien"|-0.148227334022522|"But as soon as I transform into Cat Noir, she'll know it's me."|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Plagg"|-0.6702980697155|"Nope! Because when your personality changes, your costume changes too! Up until now, whenever you transform into Cat Noir, you didn't think about it, it was natural.

"Cat Walker"|-0.518447875976562|" Answering your questions would risk revealing my secret identity."|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Ladybug"|0.271886706352234|" Wow, you really are perfect. Um- I mean- your answer was perfect. Let's see how well you think on your feet. Say, a supervillain shows up and you know nothing about them. What would be your first reaction? A, you rush towards them and cataclysm them, B, you-"|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Cat Walker"|0.616413593292236|"First I get to a safe place to observe them. And that's what you should do too, Ladybug."|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Ladybug"|-0.645184546709061|" You know, I guess there's no more time for chit-chat. Let's get to work right now!No, Cat Noir, stop! This is ridiculous!"|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Cat Walker"|-0.365737557411194|" You think that's Cat Noir?"|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Ladybug"|-0.398374140262604|" Of course it's Cat Noir! He must've been akumatized because he regrets having given up his Miraculous!"|4|100|"Kuro Neko"

"Cat Walker"|-0.351744771003723|" If that was Cat Noir, don't you think he'd talk to you?"|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Ladybug"|-0.424592137336731|" It's true, he usually does talk a lot more. He must be really upset that I found someone to take his place!"|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Cat Walker"|-0.373949229717255|" With that slot on his back, he looks more like a piggy bank, don't you think?"|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Ladybug"|0.167365193367004|" You'll see once we deakumatize him.Cataclysm his bell, I'm sure that's where the akuma is!"|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Cat Walker"|-0.582700908184052|" Hang on!Ladybug, what if that's a sentimonster? If I use my power on him, he'll lose control and become more dangerous!"|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Ladybug"|-0.133678913116455|"You're right! Wow, Plagg really took his job as a coach seriously!But trust me, I know Cat Noir-Hey, what are you doing?!"|4|100|"Kuro Neko"

"Cat Walker"|-0.461271703243256|" Cats sometimes eat grass, it helps them spit out their hairballs."|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Ladybug"|-0.387857019901276|" Cat Noir loves acting like a clown, but he wouldn't go so far as to eat real grass."|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Cat Walker"|-0.486258268356323|"What I mean is you're right to doubt, and I agree with you. Until we know for sure whether we're dealing with a sentimonster, someone who's been akumatized, we shouldn't make any brash decisions.Let's find out more."|4|100|"Kuro Neko"

"Ladybug"|-0.680911183357239|" Yeah, but hello? I just confused my former partner with a giant piggy bank! I didn't see he was hurt and couldn't stop him from leaving either. I must be the worst Guardian ever!"|4|100|"Kuro Neko"
"Cat Walker"|-0.743864297866821|" There's nothing wrong with you. Maybe the Boy who was Cat Noir was more sensitive than it seemed. But his feelings for you shouldn't force you to pay more attention to him than to others. You take care of everybody equally, Ladybug.Now I want to take care of you."|4|100|"Kuro Neko"

Ms. Mendeleiev|Alec|0.656959891319275| Hello, thank you for having me.|3|67|Kwamibuster
Alec|Kim|-0.431160151958466|You're going to describe an innovative scientific theory to our panel of experts who will then decide if it's true or false.|3|67|Kwamibuster
Kim|Mr. Damocles|-0.668777197599411| True or false!|3|67|Kwamibuster
Mr. Damocles|Alec|-0.076998770236969| Sit!|3|67|Kwamibuster
Alec|Mr. Banana|0.447527050971985| So, Ms. Mendeleiev, you already know our jury, its members are, as always: the famous singer XY and the one and only Mr. Banana!|3|67|Kwamibuster
Mr. Banana|Alec|0.665988922119141|Stay peachy!|3|67|Kwamibuster
Alec|Ms. Mendeleiev|0.678514361381531| And the incredible Manon Chamack, daughter of our favorite news reporter Nadja Chamack. Over to you, Ms. Mendeleiev.|3|67|Kwamibuster
Ms. Mendeleiev|Chloé|0.507125973701477| What are you about to witness is proof of the existence of interdimensional creatures with incredible powers who can move through matter and seem to be attracted to aged cheese.I discovered the first of these creatures soon after school began in September,I started observing it closely. Then, I discovered a second one. I have proof, watch closely:you can't see the creatures themselves because they are not filmable- but look right there.Given that I was unable to capture these creatures on video, I've made sketches of them to give you an idea of what they look like.|3|67|Kwamibuster
Chloé|Max|-0.64627268910408| What's that even supposed to be?|3|67|Kwamibuster
Max|Alec|-0.552174419164658| I seriously doubt this show was remotely scientific whatsoever.|3|67|Kwamibuster
Alec|Ms. Mendeleiev|-0.728893756866455| Ms. Mendeleiev,are you actually serious about chasing cheese-eating ghosts?|3|67|Kwamibuster
Ms. Mendeleiev|Marinette|0.364567995071411| I'm always serious.|3|67|Kwamibuster
Marinette|Tikki|-0.690618932247162| I thought we didn't keep secrets from one another...!|3|67|Kwamibuster
Tikki|Marinette|-0.770748496055603| I didn't want to bother you with Kwami nonsense. Besides, I thought the problem had been resolved, Plagg promised he wouldn't eat any of that magic cheese anymore.|3|67|Kwamibuster
Marinette|Tikki|-0.0231446027755737| Wait a sec! If Plagg was there too, that means he was here in this school! Which means Cat Noir is a student at Françoise Dupont, just like me?! And if I just figured this out, then that means that Cat Noir probably just figured out that I figured out that he figured it out!|3|67|Kwamibuster
Tikki|Marinette|-0.589540839195251| Uh, no, not at all! You know, Plagg would travel for miles just to sink his teeth into good cheese. |3|67|Kwamibuster
Marinette|Tikki|-0.729123443365097|You see the problem now is that I'm always going to wonder whether you're lying or not. |3|67|Kwamibuster
Tikki|Marinette|-0.712900578975677| I'm so sorry, Marinette.|3|67|Kwamibuster
Marinette|Alec|-0.562995404005051| It's okay. I know you're trying to protect me. If I figure out who he is, I'll have to give up my Miraculous and Ladybug. So I won't try, and I hope he doesn't either.|3|67|Kwamibuster
Alec|Kim|0.184194684028625| It's time for our jury to vote and tell us if the theories we heard tonight aretrue or false!Jalil Kubdel hypothesized that Egyptian pyramids are in fact: alien spaceships that came down to Earth because they ran out of gas! What do you think?|3|67|Kwamibuster
Kim|Alec|0.25313675403595|Alix, look! It's your brother!|3|67|Kwamibuster

Mr. Banana|Ms. Mendeleiev|0.665988922119141|Stay peachy! |3|67|Kwamibuster
Ms. Mendeleiev|Alec|0.052947998046875| It wasn't fake, I swear! This is an authentic, major scientific discovery! |3|67|Kwamibuster

Adrien|Plagg|-0.640039950609207| You could've been captured! That was so irresponsible of you!|3|67|Kwamibuster
Plagg|Adrien|-0.737002372741699| Puh-lease, it's impossible to capture a kwami. May I remind you that we can move through matter and we can't be filmed or photographed? You're as much of a party pooper as Sugarcube.|3|67|Kwamibuster

Plagg|Adrien|-0.466947257518768| Uh Tikki, Ladybug's kwami. |3|67|Kwamibuster
Adrien|Plagg|0.410293817520142| Wait a second. If Tikki was there, too, then that means she was here at school, which means Ladybug is a student at Françoise Dupont just like me, which means I probably know Ladybug already.|3|67|Kwamibuster
Plagg|Alec|-0.714672952890396| Uh-oh! Uh-oh!|3|67|Kwamibuster
Alec|Alya|0.647716641426086| A big thank you to all our scientists and members of the jury! We'll see you again next week for another edition ofAlternative Truth! |3|67|Kwamibuster

Adrien|Plagg|0.171954751014709| Plagg, what if... Marinette were Ladybug...?|3|67|Kwamibuster
Plagg|Adrien|-0.474736571311951| Marinette? Nah! Besides, you shouldn't be trying to find out more, if you discovered Ladybug's true identity you'd have to give your Miraculous back! So if I were you, I'd act like nothing's going on. That's what I always do when there's a problem, and it's always worked out just fine for me!|3|67|Kwamibuster
Adrien|Alec|-0.216868281364441| Maybe for once I'd better listen to you. Plagg, claws out! |3|67|Kwamibuster

Cat Noir|Ladybug|0.1490318775177| This Kwamibuster villain, she's from Françoise Dupont High School, right?|3|67|Kwamibuster
Ladybug|Kwamibuster|-0.0121172666549683| Don't forget the rules, Cat Noir. We can't know each other secret identiti- Ah! |3|67|Kwamibuster

Marinette|Master Fu|-0.214837849140167| And that's why I'm going to fix everything and save Tikki!|3|67|Kwamibuster
Master Fu|Marinette|0.0777714252471924|Marinette Dupain-Cheng, you have to pick a Miraculous, only this time, you won't be giving it to someone else. You'll wear it yourself, until you get Tikki back.You can't do that! Merging Miraculous would give you way too much power! It could make you lose your mind!|3|67|Kwamibuster
Marinette|Marinette|-0.0925272703170776|Don't worry, Master, I only need one power, the Mouse's. I'm just wearing the other Miraculous so I can free the Kwamis. I need them to pull off my plan.|3|67|Kwamibuster

Marinette|Tikki|0.37033474445343| I did it, Tikki!|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Tikki|Sabine|0.417997241020203| You see? You were up to it!|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Sabine|Mr. Bourgeois|0.471929430961609|Marinette! Dinner time!|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Mr. Bourgeois|Adrien|0.768234372138977| I am pleased to announce that we will organize a huge celebration in honor of our city's new protectors. Ladybug and Cat Noir.|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Adrien|Plagg|0.0496984720230103| Ladybug. Her name is Ladybug...|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Plagg|Adrien|-0.646385818719864| Eww, what is this?|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Adrien|Plagg|0.648656487464905| Seriously? My personal chef made all this!|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Plagg|Adrien|-0.272945523262024| If you expect me to get my energy back after the transformation, i need to eat something more... delicate!|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Adrien|Sabine|0.576833724975586| Okay. What do you want?|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Sabine|Marinette|-0.389807522296906|Oh my!|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Marinette|Nadja|-0.439915597438812| Hmmm?|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Nadja|Adrien|0.315104246139526| Just as Paris is about to celebrate the appearance of our two new superheroes, Ladybug and Cat Noir, a new wave of panic is sweeping across the capital as dozens of people are mysteriously transformed into stone monsters. It's simply unbelievable.|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Adrien|Nadja|0.0521904230117798| Camembert cheese. Fantastic. All he eats is Camembert, which means I'm gonna smell like stinky old cheese.|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Nadja|Adrien|-0.0249303579330444| These victims transformed into stone beings are still like statues. The police are perplexed to what will happen to them. Will they come back to life or be frozen in time forever?|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Adrien|Marinette|-0.675675272941589| Plagg? What's going on? I thought we defeated him.|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Marinette|Tikki|-0.136356592178345| What's capturing the akuma got to do with the other stone beings?|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Tikki|Marinette|0.029869556427002| An akuma can multiply, that's why it must be captured. If Ivan's emotions become negative again, then the akuma will turn him back into Stoneheart! He'll control all the stone beings and bring them to life to serve as his army!|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Marinette|Tikki|-0.773125067353249| So that means... this is all my fault? I knew it! See, Tikki? I'm not cut out to be a superhero! I'm only gonna keep messing up.|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Tikki|Marinette|0.0670595169067383| Keep calm. It was your first time. You're going to go back and capture Stoneheart's akuma, and do it successfully!|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Marinette|Adrien|-0.739185124635696| I can't! I told you, I'm clumsy! I create disaster all the time! I'll only make things worse for me, for you and for everyone. Cat Noir will be better off without me. I'm quitting.|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Adrien|Plagg|-0.272393047809601| SO I can't do anything without Ladybug?|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Plagg|Marinette|-0.591526985168457| Only Ladybug can capture akumas and repair damage caused by supervillains.|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Marinette|Tikki|-0.710238456726074| If Cat Noir can't capture the akumas, then... just find another Ladybug. I told you, I'm not cut out to be Ladybug!I'm sorry Tikki.|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Tikki|Marinette|-0.54985311627388| No, don't do tha|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Marinette|Hawk Moth|-0.749118745326996| ...Tikki?I'm really sorry, Tikki...|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Hawk Moth|Male voice|-0.541437566280365| Ivan has a sensitive heart. It won't be long before anger and sadness strike again. And he and the stone beings will come alive. Then we'll see how long you will remain hidden, Ladybug and Cat Noir. Once I have your Miraculous, you will be powerless against me.Everyone will be powerless against me! . I will have absolute power! Mwahahahaha!|99999|99999|Ladybug & Cat Noir (Origins - Part 1)
Adrien|Plagg|0.223945498466492| What do you think, Plagg?|1|25|Ladybug
Plagg|Adrien|-0.794179767370224|Ugh, what's the point of giving someone something that can't be eaten and doesn't have a scent? If you gave me that, I'd be seriously offended.|1|25|Ladybug
Adrien|Gabriel|-0.24499648809433| Maybe I should get a second opinion.|1|25|Ladybug
Gabriel|Adrien|0.0576951503753662| What is it?|1|25|Ladybug
Adrien|Gabriel|0.738757967948914| It's a gift I've made for Marinette. We're organizing a surprise birthday party for her.|1|25|Ladybug

Gabriel|Adrien|-0.696874111890793| I don't remember giving you permission to go to your friend's birthday party.|1|25|Ladybug
Adrien|Gabriel|0.352672815322876| Please, Father! Marinette deserves to have all her friends there.|1|25|Ladybug

Marinette|Adrien|-0.587292939424515| Ah...|1|25|Ladybug
Adrien|Gabriel|0.731539249420166| I always carry the lucky charm you gave me wherever I go, and I think it works pretty well. So..|1|25|Ladybug
Gabriel|Lila|-0.738436043262482| I thought you were supposed to protect Adrien from Marinette. The one you said was a bad influence.|1|25|Ladybug
Lila|Marinette|-0.388201773166656| From now on, you and I are at war. You will lose your friends and wind up all alone and Adrien will soon be mine.|1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Lila|0.542952656745911| We'll see about that, Lila, we'll see.|1|25|Ladybug
Lila|Lila|0.408264636993408| My plan is taking a little longer than expected, sir. But you won't be disappointed.|1|25|Ladybug
Lila|Gabriel|0.28348433971405| Will you keep your promise if I succeed?|1|25|Ladybug
Gabriel|Nathalie|0.494966745376587| I always honor my commitments. |1|25|Ladybug
Nathalie|Gabriel|-0.678523480892181| You work too hard, sir.|1|25|Ladybug
Gabriel|Lila|-0.624233424663544| Now's not the time to ease up, Nathalie.|1|25|Ladybug
Lila|Marinette|0.788978576660156|I'm good friends with the best manga publisher in Japan, you know. I can talk to them about your comic book project if you like.|1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Alya|-0.637187242507935| She's such a liar!|1|25|Ladybug
Alya|Miss Bustier|-0.251589119434357| You gotta stop obsessing over her, Marinette.|1|25|Ladybug
Miss Bustier|Marinette|-0.00796669721603394| I've graded your mock exam papers. Most of you did quite well, some better than others, but before I hand them back, Marinette, could you bring your schoolbag to me, please? I need to check something.Today, someone placed an anonymous note in my mailbox, claiming that you'd stolen the exam answers, and it looks like the anonymous person was right! |1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Miss Bustier|-0.541109204292297| But that's not true! Someone must've planted that piece of paper in my bag!|1|25|Ladybug
Miss Bustier|Marinette|0.173953175544739| But you've answered all of the questions correctly.|1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Alya|0.283830165863037| I did? Yes, but because I've studied.|1|25|Ladybug
Alya|Lila|0.346729636192322| Miss Bustier, Marinette always scores high on your tests.|1|25|Ladybug
Lila|Marinette|-0.747935950756073| This is so terribly unlike you, Marinette. You're usually so well-behaved.|1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Lila|0.220953226089478| Of course! You put the answers in my bag! You're the \anonymous informer\!|1|25|Ladybug
Lila|Miss Bustier|-0.616275191307068|I'm coming to your defense and you're accusing me?!|1|25|Ladybug
Miss Bustier|Marinette|-0.62348410487175| You can't accuse someone without proof, Marinette.|1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Miss Bustier|-0.725587069988251| But I'm sure it's her! She stole the test answers!|1|25|Ladybug
Miss Bustier|Marinette|-0.74619847536087| That's impossible, Marinette. Lila got the worst grade in the class.|1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Adrien|-0.733056873083115| Then... she flunked the exam on purpose!|1|25|Ladybug
Adrien|Alya|-0.620480984449387| Excuse me, Miss Bustier, but everyone here knows it isn't like Marinette to cheat.|1|25|Ladybug
Alya|Rose|0.0244362354278564| He's right!|1|25|Ladybug
Rose|Miss Bustier|-0.692518502473831| It doesn't make sense! |1|25|Ladybug
Miss Bustier|Lila|-0.376729547977448|Marinette, Lila, please go to the principal's office until we get to the bottom of this.|1|25|Ladybug

Marinette|Lila|-0.684181183576584| But, sir, it wasn't me! I didn't do anything!|1|25|Ladybug
Lila|Marinette|-0.761264324188232| I don't know why Marinette doesn't like me! I've really tried to be her friend, but she keeps calling me a liar, getting the others to gang up against me, and now, she's pushing me down the stairs? |1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Mr. Damocles|-0.659026473760605| Those are total lies!|1|25|Ladybug
Mr. Damocles|Lila|0.521598815917969| Go on, Lila.|1|25|Ladybug

Tom|Sabine|-0.660750985145569| My daughter is not a thief!|1|25|Ladybug
Sabine|Lila|-0.675376087427139| Why should we believe any of this? You're accusing her without any proof!|1|25|Ladybug
Lila|Mr. Damocles|0.479273200035095| Oh, I have proof.|1|25|Ladybug

Adrien|Mr. Damocles|-0.655096530914307| Mr. Damocles, I don't think-|1|25|Ladybug
Mr. Damocles|Hawk Moth|-0.740248888731003| Marinette Dupain-Cheng, you are expelled from this school! |1|25|Ladybug
Hawk Moth|Nathalie|0.0793542861938477| Lila Rossi was right! This was worth the wait! The downfall of Marinette brings about the despair of everyone who trusted her. I can feel the huge waves of negative emotions as they come crashing down!Are you ready, Nathalie?|1|25|Ladybug
Nathalie|Hawk Moth|-0.154266119003296| More than ever.|1|25|Ladybug

Scarlet Moth|Catalyst|-0.474607169628143| Since the innocent isn't to be believed anymore, I'm giving you both the power to expose the truth. As for you, my desperate loyal ones, disappointed by she who you once admired so much? I'm glad to have you back. In return, you will bring me Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.What's wrong?|1|25|Ladybug
Catalyst|Scarlet Moth|-0.681486338376999| Nothing, everything's fine. Keep going-|1|25|Ladybug
Scarlet Moth|Tikki|-0.386512696743011| Dark wings fall!|1|25|Ladybug
Tikki|Marinette|-0.0563114285469055| If you had been akumatized, nothing could have stopped you from having your Miraculous over to Hawk Moth!|1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Tikki|-0.498125433921814| And there would have been no more Ladybug. End of story.|1|25|Ladybug
Tikki|Marinette|-0.651040732860565| We can't let that happen!|1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Tikki|-0.527258664369583| Neither Lila nor Hawk Moth will win. I'm gonna prove my innocence! If only Alya could help me.|1|25|Ladybug
Tikki|Marinette|-0.321710765361786| Alya didn't become akumatized earlier today at school. I'm sure it's because she trusts you. Call her!|1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Alya|0.344954013824463| You're right!|1|25|Ladybug
Alya|Marinette|-0.689147919416428|So let's recap, right. You're accused of stealing the answers to the mock exam. Evidence 1: The paper with the answers was found in your schoolbag. You're also accused of pushing Lila down the stairs. No one witnessed the actual incident, but everyone did see Lila at the bottom of the staircase. You're also accused of stealing Lila's necklace, which was, Evidence 2, found inside your locker. And finally, you have a motive. I know for a fact that you've hated Lila from Day 1 because she hangs around Adrien.|1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Alya|0.63564658164978|I'm so glad I called you. Thanks for your support.|1|25|Ladybug
Alya|Marinette|0.422218680381775| You're my best friend, Marinette. I totally believe you, but the evidence is stacked against you. The good thing is, the world's greatest reporters always seek the truth, so I'm gonna prove your innocence.|1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Alya|0.417637705802917|Thanks, Al! |1|25|Ladybug
Alya|Marinette|-0.531227588653564| First off, a culprit always leaves clues. That's a given. And by following these clues, it will lead us...|1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Alya|0.264452457427979| ...to Lila!|1|25|Ladybug
Alya|Marinette|-0.655048191547394| No, to the guilty party. If you're so quick to accuse Lila, you might just overlook another potential baddie!|1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Alya|-0.695665687322617| Oh.Right.|1|25|Ladybug
Alya|Sabine|-0.500988662242889| Whoever it was had to have touched your locker when they put the necklace in there. I'm gonna go track down some fingerprints.|1|25|Ladybug
Sabine|Marinette|0.0707244873046875| Marinette, can we have a word?|1|25|Ladybug

Sabine|Marinette|-0.173558712005615| Now listen, honey, we love you but this whole thing has gotten very complicated. And until we've found a new school for you, we've decided that you should help us with the bakery.|1|25|Ladybug
Marinette|Tom|-0.504056304693222| But I'm telling you, I didn't do anything! If I have spent all my time in here, how am I going to be able to prove that I'm innocent?|1|25|Ladybug

Doctor|Gabriel|0.295683026313782| Once again, Mr. Agreste, make sure she gets lots of rest.|1|25|Ladybug
Gabriel|Nathalie|0.537240505218506| Of course. Thank you, doctor. |1|25|Ladybug
Nathalie|Gabriel|-0.46147221326828| Perhaps you can still take advantage of the chaos that Lila Rossi has reeked. |1|25|Ladybug
Gabriel|Nathalie|-0.623782813549042| That plan is pointless without you.|1|25|Ladybug
Nathalie|Gabriel|-0.00624287128448486| You're right. Then I have to... |1|25|Ladybug
Gabriel|Nathalie|-0.594932556152344| There will be no more Catalyst, or Mayura. I warned you.Using a broken Miraculous ends up breaking its wearer. The wounds of the Miraculous are becoming your wounds.|1|25|Ladybug

Nathalie|Duusu|0.475414991378784| Gabriel would never allow me to do this, but I'm going to create a very powerful sentimonster. The most powerful one that's ever existed. |1|25|Ladybug
Duusu|Nathalie|-0.685726881027222| No, don't do that! You should be resting.|1|25|Ladybug
Nathalie|Duusu|0.653583526611328| Gabriel so desperately wants the Miraculous, and I want to be the one to give it to him!|1|25|Ladybug

Marinette|Lila|-0.390044450759888| People should know better. Things aren't always what they seem to be at first sight. So look, I don't know why you felt the urge to start all this, or why all of a sudden you lied to fix this mess, but I'm glad to see you're capable of coming back to your senses. Sometimes.|1|25|Ladybug
Lila|Tom|-0.0954192280769348| As you said, things aren't always what they seem to be at first sight. |1|25|Ladybug

Alya|Marinette|0.261122941970825| Yeah.|2|50|Malediktator
Marinette|Tikki|-0.666115045547485| Without Chloé around, Paris will be filled with a lot less negative emotion!|2|50|Malediktator
Tikki|Adrien|-0.591653436422348| And less akumatizations.|2|50|Malediktator
Adrien|Marinette|0.604442834854126| Hey, what’s going on here? What are we celebrating?|2|50|Malediktator
Marinette|Adrien|-0.611436814069748| Chloé’s gone! She’s moving to New York!|2|50|Malediktator
Adrien|Marinette|-0.0670545697212219| Chloé left…? For good?|2|50|Malediktator
Marinette|Adrien|0.545393824577332|Yeah! Isn’t it great?|2|50|Malediktator
Adrien|Marinette|-0.397122800350189| Uh… no. I think it’s terrible! How can you celebrate a thing like that?|2|50|Malediktator
Marinette|Adrien|-0.762672081589699|But, Chloé’s a total brat to everyone. She was useless anyway.|2|50|Malediktator
Adrien|Marinette|-0.550102531909943| Nobody's useless, not even Chloé. When I was little and wasn't allowed out, she was the only friend I had.|2|50|Malediktator
Marinette|Adrien|-0.632356405258179| Ow— well, uh… shoot.|2|50|Malediktator
Adrien|Marinette|-0.736347913742065| She left angry and unhappy. I can't celebrate that. |2|50|Malediktator
Marinette|Malediktator|-0.731166064739227| Uh—I'm really sorry, Adrien.|2|50|Malediktator
Malediktator|Audrey|0.505001544952393| By the power vested in me, I order you to land! |2|50|Malediktator
Audrey|Malediktator|-0.474682629108429|This is not the airport. What is the meaning of this?|2|50|Malediktator
Malediktator|Chloé|-0.230982899665833| Chloé, my daughter, you are not leaving for New York. |2|50|Malediktator
Chloé|Malediktator|-0.0828880071640015|Daddy?|2|50|Malediktator
Malediktator|Chloé|0.0495257377624512| You see, I have the power to shut down the school and banish all those nasty students who were mean to you. Come with me! |2|50|Malediktator
Chloé|Audrey|0.443041920661926| Really? But that’s… excellent?|2|50|Malediktator
Audrey|Malediktator|-0.564589142799377| André, getting yourself akumatized like everybody else in this town does not make you a cool or hip father. In fact—|2|50|Malediktator
Malediktator|Audrey|0.683214068412781| By the power vested in me, I declare that you will be devoted to this family and remain in Paris with me and Chloé. |2|50|Malediktator

Malediktator|Audrey|-0.284645676612854| Chloé, sweetie, why don't you come—Huh?Where did she go?!|2|50|Malediktator
Audrey|Hawk Moth|-0.0656164288520813|Don't worry, I'm sure we'll find her.|2|50|Malediktator
Hawk Moth|Malediktator|-0.488014221191406|Malediktator, if you want to find your daughter, you must first cause chaos in Paris. Start with the school. She'll come back of her own accord.|2|50|Malediktator
Malediktator|Alya|-0.422958970069885| Good idea! Let's go show those little savages what they get for showing my daughter such disrespect.|2|50|Malediktator
Alya|Marinette|-0.756853103637695| Come on, girl. Just 'cause Adrien's bummed out doesn't mean you have to be, too.|2|50|Malediktator
Marinette|Alya|-0.713221460580826| Yeah, but I think I was a bit harsh on her earlier. What if Adrien's right and Chloé isn't just a brat?|2|50|Malediktator
Alya|Malediktator|-0.110182762145996| What else could she possibly be? Superbrat, maybe. |2|50|Malediktator

Tikki|Marinette|-0.241200029850006| Looks like Chloé managed one last victim before she left Paris.|2|50|Malediktator
Marinette|Marinette|-0.678715407848358| Yeah, and I might be partly to blame.|2|50|Malediktator
Marinette|Malediktator|-0.203119039535522| Tikki, spots on! Yeah!|2|50|Malediktator
Malediktator|Cat Noir|0.461697936058044| Where is that Marinette?|2|50|Malediktator
Cat Noir|Malediktator|-0.0490202307701111|Hey, you! Do you have a demolition permit for this school?|2|50|Malediktator
Malediktator|Ladybug|-0.00984162092208862| I don't need a permit. I am Malediktator, the all-powerful supermayor of Paris, and this is my city.|2|50|Malediktator

Cat Noir|Ladybug|0.0940481424331665| While you figure that out, I'll take care of Malediktator. |2|50|Malediktator
Ladybug|Cat Noir|-0.247944056987762|Uh, of course! Cat Noir, wait!|2|50|Malediktator

Malediktator|Master Fu|-0.0101670026779175|He's completely harmless now. Taking his Miraculous would be like taking candy from a baby.|2|50|Malediktator
Master Fu|Marinette|0.191263318061829| Six hundred fifty.|2|50|Malediktator
Marinette|Master Fu|-0.222918152809143|Master Fu! A villain has transformed Cat Noir… into a cat!|2|50|Malediktator
Master Fu|Marinette|-0.700370252132416| What?! But… perhaps you shouldn't have left him by himself. He's at Hawk Moth's mercy!|2|50|Malediktator
Marinette|Master Fu|0.308852791786194| I know, but the Lucky Charm led me here!|2|50|Malediktator
Master Fu|Marinette|0.636924028396606| Hmm. And the Lucky Charm never fails.Marinette Dupain-Cheng, pick an ally you can trust to fight alongside you on this mission. Choose wisely; such powers are meant to serve the greater good. Once the mission is over, you'll retrieve the Miraculous from them.|2|50|Malediktator
Marinette|Tikki|-0.620104372501373| I must choose someone who's not impressed by people in power. Who can help me trap Malediktator. Huh?! Of course! That's it.Wait, what am I thinking? |2|50|Malediktator
Tikki|Master Fu|0.250976324081421| Follow your instincts, Marinette.|2|50|Malediktator

Chloé|Ladybug|0.227262496948242| Ladybug, finally! You're going to help me, right?|2|50|Malediktator
Ladybug|Chloé|-0.721117675304413| I'm fine with helping you, Chloé, but first… I need you to tell me what happened. Why is your father— I mean, Malediktator, so mad?|2|50|Malediktator
Chloé|Ladybug|-0.691714584827423| It's because of this super lame loser named Marinette Dupain-Cheng. She's this horrible girl in my class and she hates me.She's ganged everyone up against me and she—|2|50|Malediktator
Ladybug|Chloé|-0.757454976439476| Maybe this Marinette girl isn't entirely to blame?|2|50|Malediktator
Chloé|Ladybug|-0.792952179908752| Uh! Ugh. Okay, it wasn't totally Marinette's fault. She is really mean to me sometimes, but actually, this time, Daddy got angry all by himself.|2|50|Malediktator
Ladybug|Chloé|-0.265390276908875|All by himself?|2|50|Malediktator
Chloé|Ladybug|-0.721694082021713| Yeah, because… there was something he couldn't do…|2|50|Malediktator

Chloé|Ladybug|-0.735043406486511| It— it was me. I hurt my daddy's feelings. Because I want to leave Paris, forever.|2|50|Malediktator
Ladybug|Chloé|-0.776907473802567| Because of what happened in school? I'm sure Marinette probably didn't exactly mean what she said.|2|50|Malediktator
Chloé|Ladybug|-0.722661435604095| Oh, it's not just her— actually, I don't even care about her— it's because I have no reason to be here: nobody likes me; I have no friends. I'm… useless.|2|50|Malediktator
Ladybug|Chloé|-0.69894003868103|A friend once told me: nobody is useless, Chloé.|2|50|Malediktator

Ladybug|Chloé|0.0354734659194946|Mm-hmm.|2|50|Malediktator
Chloé|Ladybug|-0.766182109713554| Oh! I'm so embarrassed. That film's ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous. I realize that now.|2|50|Malediktator
Ladybug|Chloé|-0.448039650917053| Don't worry Chloé. You can fix your own messes, if that's what you want. You, too, can serve a purpose, but you have to want to.|2|50|Malediktator
Chloé|Ladybug|0.479256629943848|I do want to.|2|50|Malediktator

Mayor Bourgeois|Chloé|-0.146788001060486| And the floor in the tower will be built with recycled wood from the trees we cut down. Very eco-friendly.|4|91|Mega Leech
Chloé|Marinette|-0.630472153425217| And real trees have to be watered. Talk about wasting water! |4|91|Mega Leech
Marinette|Mayor Bourgeois|-0.62944284081459| Mayor Bourgeois, perhaps Mylène and Ivan have misunderstood your project. Do you really want to take away the trees, a natural and cost-free air filter, and replace them with a tower that will absorb polluted air? So that afterwards, you can clean the air and sell it back in plastic bottles. The same bottles which will become trash and pollute our oceans?|4|91|Mega Leech
Mayor Bourgeois|Alya|-0.593547314405441| Yes, that’s it.Uh, I mean, no. Of course not! It’s not that simple. Ecology is complicated, especially for children your age. Leave these things to the adults.|4|91|Mega Leech
Alya|Miss Bustier|-0.186277508735657| So actually, your project is all about cutting down our trees and closing our favorite park. |4|91|Mega Leech
Miss Bustier|Marinette|-0.505063652992249| And if Mylène and Ivan are trying to stop this, then we are on their side.|4|91|Mega Leech
Marinette|Mylène|-0.697430491447449| It’s true. The Mayor’s solution for fighting pollution is misguided.|4|91|Mega Leech
Mylène|Marinette|-0.346751749515533| Like so many other so-called miracle solutions that are supposed to deal with ecological problems, the thing is there’s never just one simple solution that can fix everything. What we need are lots of small solutions that can tackle the problem all at the same time. That’s why there has to be a lot of us all working together.|4|91|Mega Leech
Marinette|Mylène|-0.62433135509491| Good thing you and Ivan got involved to stop this, but why didn’t you guys tell us about it? The whole class would have come with you. |4|91|Mega Leech

Ladybug|Queen Bee|-0.663976907730103| Sorry, but I think this belongs to me now. |99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Queen Bee|Ladybug|-0.589184731245041| I don't need all those stupid Miraculous anyway! I only need the Queen Bee! (throws of all the Miraculouses except for the New York with mommy! And I'll be the one and only Queen Bee there! And I'll save the world all by myself, without you and your ridiculous, poorly chosen friends! Utterly poorly chosen!|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Ladybug|Chloé|-0.728126853704453| I'm sorry, Chloé, but I can't let you do that. |99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Chloé|Cat Noir|-0.674819558858871| Well, if that's the way it is, I'm no longer your fan, Ladybug! I don't love you, anymore! And I'm still going to leave with mommy anyway, because you don't deserve to breathe the same air I do! |99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Cat Noir|Ladybug|-0.694656044244766| Sorry, couldn't catch up with them.|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Ladybug|Gabriel|0.365017414093018| Master! Master? Wake up!|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Gabriel|Nathalie|-0.60585081577301| Oh, my Nathalie. There are no words to express how sorry I am. I failed yet again, and you have used up every last bit of strength, for nothing.|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Nathalie|Ladybug|-0.272996366024017| No. Not for nothing. There's a deciphered version of the grimoire stored on the Guardian's tablet! Now we can fix the Peacock Miraculous! |99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Ladybug|Ladybug|0.576686859130859| Master! Master? |99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)

Cat Noir|Wayzz|-0.723663210868835| Has he... lost his memory?|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Wayzz|Ladybug|-0.065509021282196|It's the rule of the Guardians. Their memory gets erased when they pass on the box, to protect the secret identities of the Miraculous holders.|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Ladybug|Master Fu|-0.104731261730194| It's all good. We're friends, sir!|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Master Fu|Wayzz|0.773317098617554| Well, nice to meet you!|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Wayzz|Cat Noir|-0.378377139568329|Goodbye, Master.|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Cat Noir|Ladybug|-0.677062690258026| Wait! You haven't repaired everything yet. There's still hope!|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Ladybug|Ladybug|0.687007427215576| Oh! Of course! Miraculous Ladybug! |99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Ladybug|Master Fu|0.514133095741272| Master! Do you remember me?|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Master Fu|Ladybug|-0.103454172611237| I'm sorry to disappoint you, young lady, but this is the first time I've ever set eyes on you.|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Ladybug|Cat Noir|0.445724606513977|Yes, of course.|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Cat Noir|Ladybug|-0.68874591588974| What happened to him has nothing to do with the damages caused by Chloé.|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Ladybug|Master Fu|-0.431615114212036| So my magical ladybugs couldn't do anything.|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Master Fu|Chloé|-0.717796713113785| It's a shame you threw such a pretty keyring away! I could have used it for my key. They were matching too! |99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Chloé|Mayor Bourgeois|-0.143862783908844|Mom! I hope Jean-Patrick has finished packing our suitcases! We're leaving right now! |99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Mayor Bourgeois|Audrey Bourgeois|-0.100809633731842| Chloé! Your mother has decided to stay, after all!|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Audrey Bourgeois|Mayor Bourgeois|-0.267356932163239| Yes. We've undoubtedly made our share of mistakes along the way, but then who hasn't? What matters is to fix them, right?|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Mayor Bourgeois|Chloé|0.457878232002258| Oh! My queen! |99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Chloé|Marinette|-0.769600450992584|Ew! This is despicable! Utterly despicable! I order you both to fight again!|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Marinette|Master Fu|-0.256532371044159| As we grow old, we realize life doesn't always give us all the gifts we hoped it would. I would have loved to tell you all this in person, Marinette, but if you're reading this, it means I've already lost my memory. But you mustn't be scared, and you mustn't be sad. As I was telling you at the beginning of this letter, experiencing loss is a part of life, but it doesn't define it. Because what really matters isn't whether you win or lose. It's the ability to...|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Master Fu|Master Fu|-0.278642892837524| accept changes in ourselves. It's accepting that even if life doesn't always give us the gifts we were hoping for, the real gift is life itself.|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Master Fu|Marianne|0.72693133354187| It's incredible! I've only just met you and yet my heart is beating as if I've known you forever.|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Marianne|Marinette|0.213167667388916| You should always trust your heart.|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Marinette|Master Fu|0.643601536750793| Take this sir, for the journey. |99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Master Fu|Master Fu|0.686101675033569| Mmm-hmm. Thank you, young lady. I will never forget you. |99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Master Fu|Luka|-0.166567325592041|Even if life doesn't always give us the gifts we were hoping for, the real gift is life itself.|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Luka|Marinette|-0.361561715602875| You okay?|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Marinette|Luka|0.659644246101379| So, how about that tune? Will you let me hear it?|99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Luka|Gabriel|-0.191632151603699| Are you sure you really want to hear it? |99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Gabriel|Marinette|0.406547665596008| It's perfect!As good as new! |99999|99999|Miracle Queen (The Battle Of The Miraculous - Part 2)
Nadja|Sabrina|0.137711524963379|...help them defeat the fearsome Destroyer, Ladybug and Cat Noir...|3|63|Miraculer

Chloé|Nadja|0.489339351654053|Today's the day.|3|63|Miraculer
Nadja|Nadja|-0.116822063922882| Let's hope the guardians will defeat this villain soon! Stay tuned for updates. |3|63|Miraculer
Nadja|Chloé|-0.670599550008774| The battle between our heroes and Destroyer is in full swing!Oh no! And now Paris' most pointed monument is being ravaged by the horrendous supervillain! |3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Sabrina|-0.764879882335663| Ugh, how embarrassing. Without me around, they look ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous.|3|63|Miraculer
Sabrina|Sabrina|0.0869169235229492| Come on, Ladybug! You need help. Come and fetch Chloé!|3|63|Miraculer
Sabrina|Hawk Moth|-0.0866303443908691| Ah! Oh yes, sorry uhm... Come and fetch Queen Bee!|3|63|Miraculer
Hawk Moth|Mayura|-0.582903832197189| Mayura. Ladybug and Cat Noir are in trouble.|3|63|Miraculer
Mayura|Hawk Moth|0.246883034706116|Chloé's already waiting for her like she always does.|3|63|Miraculer
Hawk Moth|Nadja|0.695063948631287| Perfect. Be ready in case Ladybug goes and hands her the Bee Miraculous.|3|63|Miraculer
Nadja|Chloé|0.221941471099854| Ladybug calls her Lucky Charm and gets... a rubber duck? What is she going to do with that? Will Cat Noir, Rena Rouge, and Carapace...?|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Nadja|0.557928442955017| Come on! What are you waiting for? You need me!|3|63|Miraculer
Nadja|Chloé|0.215424418449402| Okay! Of course! That's brilliant! And Ladybug pulls it off yet again! She defeated Destroyer with the help of all her superhero friends! |3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Sabrina|-0.580168664455414| All? ALL!? What about Queen Bee? Ugh! |3|63|Miraculer
Sabrina|Chloé|-0.751678943634033|That's really not cool.|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Sabrina|-0.680197477340698| Oh, you so don't get it. Ladybug only calls on me when she has serious villains to contend with.|3|63|Miraculer
Sabrina|Carapace|0.175205945968628| Uhh, yeah! Of course.|3|63|Miraculer
Carapace|Rena Rouge|-0.700037032365799| Wayzz, shell off.|3|63|Miraculer
Rena Rouge|Ladybug|0.0189802646636963| Trixx, let's rest.|3|63|Miraculer
Ladybug|Nino|-0.18496161699295|And don't forget. Nobody can ever know our secret identities.|3|63|Miraculer
Nino|Ladybug|-0.565151989459991| Except us, of course.|3|63|Miraculer
Ladybug|Cat Noir|0.764467358589172|Thank you, see you next time. |3|63|Miraculer
Cat Noir|Ladybug|-0.368671774864197| Still haven't spoken to her, huh?|3|63|Miraculer
Ladybug|Cat Noir|-0.147587180137634| You know how dangerous it is to use Chloé. Everybody knows that she was Queen Bee, everyone including Hawk Moth. He can use it to trap us. That's why our identities must remain a secret.|3|63|Miraculer
Cat Noir|Ladybug|-0.163617372512817| And the best kept secrets are the ones you don't share, yeah-yeah, I know. I don't think Chloé knows that her time as Queen Bee is over, though.|3|63|Miraculer
Ladybug|Cat Noir|-0.355316579341888| I know, I just haven't time to tell her and......and I won't today either, I'm about to transform back! |3|63|Miraculer
Cat Noir|Ladybug|0.654589772224426| M'lady... promise me you'll go talk to her. It's the right thing to do.|3|63|Miraculer
Ladybug|Gabriel|0.478041410446167| Yeah, sure. |3|63|Miraculer
Gabriel|Nathalie|0.172393321990967| Chloé Bourgeois must become Queen Bee again!|3|63|Miraculer
Nathalie|Gabriel|-0.102484405040741| Are you still considering making her an ally? I'm afraid Ladybug has grown reluctant to giving Chloé the Bee Miraculous. She's being very careful.|3|63|Miraculer
Gabriel|Nathalie|0.000634431838989258| Then I will get Chloé to force Ladybug to give it to her. All I need is for her to lose all hope in Ladybug. To become angry enough so I can akumatize her. |3|63|Miraculer
Nathalie|Gabriel|0.467665672302246|Maybe it's time we bring Lila Rossi's psychological talent into the plan.|3|63|Miraculer
Gabriel|Lila|0.65911066532135| Excellent idea, Nathalie...|3|63|Miraculer
Lila|Gabriel|-0.303100764751434| I really want to thank you for trusting me, Mr. Agreste. I'm very honored to be able to protect Adrien. But I'm saddened by all the people around him. Your son deserves better than that friend of his Nino. Not to mention all the girls clamoring to catch his eye, especially that Marinette dummy and that stuck-up Chloé. Chloé! Pfft! She won't stop bragging about being Queen Bee, but Adrien couldn't care less about these girls. He's just so perfect.|3|63|Miraculer
Gabriel|Lila|-0.581071645021439| I don't think Adrien's completely indifferent to Chloé. They've had a very strong friendship ever since they were young - a relationship that no one can ruin. Thank you, Lila. I'll see you tomorrow. |3|63|Miraculer
Lila|Gabriel|0.580018281936646| Yes. See you tomorrow.|3|63|Miraculer
Gabriel|Chloé|0.659477949142456| I'm sure that this young lady will help us implement our grand plan.|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Lila|-0.719575762748718| Rena Rouge and Carapace are so tacky. I just don’t understand why Ladybug keeps calling on them and when I, Queen Bee-|3|63|Miraculer
Lila|Adrien, Nino, and Alya|0.745601534843445| Good morning, everyone!|3|63|Miraculer
Adrien, Nino, and Alya|Marinette|0.363491415977478| Hey, Lila! |3|63|Miraculer
Marinette|Nino|0.671260714530945|Yeah, let's go study for that test. |3|63|Miraculer
Nino|Adrien|0.0837932825088501| What test?|3|63|Miraculer
Adrien|Nino|0.575425982475281| The science test this afternoon.|3|63|Miraculer
Nino|Adrien|-0.249290764331818| |3|63|Miraculer
Adrien|Lila|0.550670742988586| Come on. I'll get ya up to speed. |3|63|Miraculer
Lila|Chloé|-0.393020153045654|Were you talking about Ladybug?|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Sabrina|-0.348347425460815| Uhh... who are you again?|3|63|Miraculer
Sabrina|Chloé|0.187278866767883| That’s Lila. She’s in our class!|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Lila|-0.657396346330643| Really? Well, she clearly didn't make a big impression on me.|3|63|Miraculer
Lila|Chloé|0.550413489341736|Oh, I love your sense of humor. I remember now that Ladybug mentioned it a few times.|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Lila|0.0712987184524536| You talk to Ladybug?|3|63|Miraculer
Lila|Chloé|0.790292501449585| Of course! She and I are very close friends. A bit like you used to be back in the day! Whenever I feel like seeing her, I've got a magic command that calls her to me right away.|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Lila|0.439103603363037| Magic?|3|63|Miraculer
Lila|Chloé|0.389448046684265| Yeah, just like your signal to summon her, except mine works every time.|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Lila|0.5463045835495|Well, to each her own. |3|63|Miraculer
Lila|Chloé|-0.612755239009857| Don't you want to know what it is?|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Lila|0.142391443252563|If you insist.|3|63|Miraculer
Lila|Marinette|-0.516255140304565| If Ladybug doesn't come to you with that, then you'll know she's not a true friend. |3|63|Miraculer
Marinette|Marinette|0.685716152191162|Go ahead, I'll meet you.|3|63|Miraculer
Marinette|Chloé|-0.436493813991547| Chloé?|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Marinette|0.412548899650574| What do you want, Dupain-Cheng?|3|63|Miraculer
Marinette|Chloé|-0.106205224990845| I don't know what Lila just told you but, you should watch out for her, besides I'm sure Ladybug will come and see you anyway with or without magic.|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Marinette|-0.654736369848251| You making fun of me right now?|3|63|Miraculer
Marinette|Chloé|-0.599772870540619| No, No! I'm not!|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Tikki|-0.145085275173187| I could see Ladybug WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE IT, OKAY, so mind your own business DUPAIN-CHENG.|3|63|Miraculer
Tikki|Marinette|0.180477499961853| You really got to talk to Chloé.|3|63|Miraculer
Marinette|Tikki|-0.471705257892609| But I just did. It’s pointless, obviously.|3|63|Miraculer
Tikki|Marinete|-0.161098837852478| No! Marinette talked to Chloé! You know the only person Chloé listens to is Ladybug. |3|63|Miraculer
Marinete|Hawk Moth|0.344954013824463|You’re right.|3|63|Miraculer
Hawk Moth|Mayura|0.119358062744141| Our ally is living up to our expectations. I can already feel Chloé's anger rising. Get ready, Mayura.|3|63|Miraculer

Mayura|Queen Bee|0.353744268417358|Let me ask you just one question. Do you enjoy being Ladybug's servant? Having to wait for her to loan you a Miraculous? Wouldn't you rather have boundless powers of your own?|3|63|Miraculer
Queen Bee|Mayura|-0.340754806995392|Uh, that's three questions.|3|63|Miraculer
Mayura|Queen Bee|0.692009091377258| Come with us, Chloé. You can be Queen Bee whenever you want.|3|63|Miraculer

Ladybug|Queen Bee|-0.240245461463928| That's okay, Queen Bee. We'll get her next time. |3|63|Miraculer
Queen Bee|Ladybug|-0.546506524085999| If you'd given it to me earlier, we'd probably would've defeated Hawk Moth. |3|63|Miraculer
Ladybug|Queen Bee|-0.606379479169846| I'm sorry, Chloé. I should've told you this a long time ago. I might never be able to let you be Queen Bee again.|3|63|Miraculer
Queen Bee|Ladybug|-0.281600832939148| What? But I did everything you asked me to.|3|63|Miraculer
Ladybug|Queen Bee|-0.508735984563828| I know. But this is for your own safety. It's too dangerous for you and your loved ones because Hawk Moth knows that you're Queen Bee.|3|63|Miraculer
Queen Bee|Chloé|-0.754443347454071| Buzz off. |3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Ladybug|-0.0371677875518799| I understand. But I'm sure that you'll need me again, Ladybug. I know that I'll be Queen Bee again someday. I will always be Queen Bee.|3|63|Miraculer
Ladybug|Cat Noir|0.68467390537262|Thank you, Chloé. Let's go. |3|63|Miraculer
Cat Noir|Sabrina|-0.0497583150863647| Ladies. |3|63|Miraculer
Sabrina|Chloé|-0.694146633148193|I guess you'll never wanna play with me again now.|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Sabrina|-0.250706613063812|Of course I will. I just don't wanna be Ladybug anymore.You can keep the costume if you want.|3|63|Miraculer
Sabrina|Mayura|-0.670243501663208| Oh, goody!|3|63|Miraculer
Mayura|Hawk Moth|-0.730053126811981| I'm sorry, Hawk Moth. I failed.|3|63|Miraculer
Hawk Moth|Chloé|-0.601490765810013| No, Mayura. We've set the stage for the future. Queen Bee will change her mind.|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Lila|0.0978981256484985| Hey, you!|3|63|Miraculer
Lila|Chloé|-0.436493813991547| Chloé!|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Lila|-0.216546714305878| That magic code you told me to call Ladybug? It was just a big joke, wasn't it?|3|63|Miraculer
Lila|Chloé|-0.592177897691727| Of course it wasn't. Why? Weren't you with Ladybug yesterday?|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Lila|-0.428332626819611| Uh... yes?|3|63|Miraculer
Lila|Chloé|0.423746943473816| So it worked then.|3|63|Miraculer
Chloé|Marinette|-0.528254866600037| Uh... yes? Okay, fine! You're not completely useless! |3|63|Miraculer
Marinette|Tikki|-0.73834228515625| I hope I didn't hurt Chloé's feelings too much. She's worked so hard.|3|63|Miraculer
Tikki|Nadja|0.559321641921997| It's for her own good. And you're also protecting Ladybug and Cat Noir by doing that. That's what being a superheroine is all about.|3|63|Miraculer
Ladybug|Alya|0.654746294021606| Sure, it's amazing being Ladybug. I've got these powers, kwamis, but can you imagine I could've prevented Shadow Moth from creating villains in the first place? Ha! He'd be ruined! Have you noticed that Shadow Moth seems to reakumatize people much more often these days? Do you know why? Because he gets to know them and figures out how to manipulate them better!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Alya|Ladybug|-0.485144913196564| You're right. I was akumatized four times as Lady Wifi because I was obsessed with with you! I knew you were hiding something from me and it drove me crazy.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Ladybug|Alya|-0.171819567680359| I had to keep it a secret.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Alya|Ladybug|-0.120787501335144| I know girl. But now that I know the truth, I've got your back!What? Mr. Pigeon has already been akumatized 71 times?!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Ladybug|Ladybug|-0.496701836585999| He's just a harmless guy trying to take care of his pigeons. It's so not fair! I'd promised him I'd find a way to keep him safe from Shadow Moth, but I just can't figure it out.I don't understand a thing in this spell book!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Ladybug|Ladybug|-0.0198296904563904| Oh! Hold that thought Wayzz, I think this is it! |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Ladybug|Trixx|-0.593341797590256| Ugh, I was sure that \spicy little rock\ would be pepper.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Trixx|Alya|-0.48838084936142| Alya, help us reason with her, please!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Alya|Ladybug|0.540255308151245| Marinette, how long have you been working on this? |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Ladybug|Alya|0.648551344871521| I dunno, six-seven days, maybe ten. Now that we're on spring break, I finally have time to put my whole heart into it!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Alya|Ladybug|0.298582673072815| When was the last time you worked on one of your own designs? |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Ladybug|Alya|0.252492666244507| I do loads of designing! Look!I designed a security system so that nobody can enter my room when I'm not in it. And if I put on this hatI hear everything that's going on in here, even when I'm out of the room.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Alya|Ladybug|-0.30516129732132| I'm gonna have to break it to you because I'm the only one who can.THIS IS TOTALLY INSANE! Girl, trust your BFF. When I'm researching something obsessively and I can't think of anything else, that's when my mind can get really blocked. You know what you need most right now? A break! |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Ladybug|Sabine|-0.642597228288651| No way! No breaks until I find out how to keep Shadow Moth from reakumatizing people! |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Sabine|Tom|-0.352557480335236| Tom, this science experiment is starting to worry me. |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Tom|Alya|-0.604955762624741| But you know that she asked us not to bother her.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Alya|Ladybug|0.236639261245728| I get that you wanna see the end of Shadow Moth but you know what my grandmother always says? \Life is not waiting for the storm to pass, it's learning to dance in the rain.\\"|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Ladybug|Alya|0.399874210357666| Dance? But Alya, how can I dance when I know Shadow Moth's going after the people I love?!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Alya|Ladybug|-0.524338126182556| I bet you had no idea Adrien and Kagami aren't seeing each other anymore. |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Ladybug|Alya|-0.772241801023483|What?! Are you serious?!I have to go and console Kagami!Poor thing, she must be devastated! |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Alya|Ladybug|-0.453471779823303| Hang on, don't you mean you have to go and console Adrien? |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Ladybug|Alya|-0.579413831233978| Why would I console Adrien?|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Alya|Ladybug|-0.104230999946594| The house-and-three-kids-and-a-hamster-named-whatever and all that. Does that ring a bell?|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Ladybug|Alya|-0.65777513384819| There's no way we could be together anyway, I can't even talk to him! And besides... I have... no more feelings for Adrien... I don't love him anymore, there! And Kagami is perfect for him. I mean she has no problem talking to him. And they fence together.Poor girl, she must be so upset.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Alya|Ladybug|-0.573974221944809| This is a joke right? Or maybe all those days locked in your room, breathing magical fumes must have gone to your brain? |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Ladybug|Alya|-0.652782678604126| Alya, Kagami doesn't have any friends in Paris besides me. I have to go and console her.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Alya|Ladybug|0.227453947067261| Fine! Go console Kagami if you want to. As long as you're outside, getting some fresh air and thinking about something else it's all good. Meanwhile I'm gonna go through all these notes and see if I can make any sense out of it.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Ladybug|Alya|0.028968334197998| Huh! You would do that? |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Alya|Ladybug|-0.285374343395233| You're not alone anymore, Marinette. I've got your back, remember? |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72

Tomoe|Marinette|0.345965266227722| Mmm.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Kagami|0.372322201728821| Adrien is at the pool, getting ready to shoot his next big ad campaign! It's the perfect place for the two of you to make up!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Kagami|Marinette|0.218833684921265| You know Adrien's schedule by heart?|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Kagami|0.0780124664306641| Yeah for the next three years duh! But who cares? 'Cause today's the day that I'm getting you two back together. |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Kagami|Marinette|-0.733034312725067| I don't want to get back together with Adrien. I was the one who decided to break up and-|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Kagami|0.297986388206482| Of course you did! You felt that somehow you weren't worthy of him, but you're wrong Kagami. You're strong, you're perfect! He's perfect! |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Kagami|Marinette|-0.623125314712524| Marinette!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Kagami|0.456511497497559| You're meant for each other! Right now I get it, it's out of sight, out of mind. But the second you lay eyes on him again, you'll both blush and stutter, talk nonsense about big houses, three kids and a hamster and everything will be wonderful!Sorry. Hello? |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Kagami|Marinette|-0.758821353316307| Marinette, I don't want to be with Adrien anymore. He let me down. |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Kagami|0.540941476821899| Just trust me! I can prove that he's worthy of you! Of course, makes sense. They've closed the pool to rehearse the commercial in private.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Kagami|Marinette|0.749187588691711| Perfect. Let's go. |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Plagg|-0.0836416482925415| Absolutely! Let's go... inside! By distracting the bodyguard.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Plagg|Bob Roth|-0.0358588695526123| I'm gonna have to break it to ya 'cause I'm the only one who can.This is totally insane!!Jumping into freezing water first thing in the morning when we could be peacefully eating cheese?I take back everything I said! Everything is great! Just great!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Gabriel|0.621816873550415| Okay, now picture it Gabe. Adrien is on top of the Eiffel Tower, bathed in sunlight. He jumps off, slow motion. Doves flutter all around him as if his fall would never end. The catchphrase, \dive into romantic, magical, eternal Paris!\ And then splash! Right into a giant glass of sparkling golden juice! Backshot! \Splash, the new fragrance by Gabriel.\\"|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Gabriel|Bob Roth|-0.701825797557831|Those birds are not doves, they're pigeons. |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Mr. Ramier|-0.604296684265137| Not at all! They're doves! |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Mr. Ramier|Bob Roth|-0.725637882947922| My birds aren't do-|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Gabriel|0.402461051940918| Listen Ramier, I know those are pigeons but it is in both of our best interests if Agreste believes they're doves! Mine, because he's paying me a lot of money. And yours, because I can convince the mayor to create a space specifically dedicated to pigeons in Paris. So, for today, your pigeons are doves! Got it? Okay everybody, places! Action!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Gabriel|Marinette|-0.614252775907516| Something... is missing.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Wayhem|-0.249290764331818| |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Wayhem|Gabriel|-0.186192572116852| Adrien's at the pool! There!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Gabriel|Mr. Ramier|0.570252180099487| We've got \magical Paris\ and \eternal Paris\ but we're missing \romantic Paris.\ A red rose! I want one of these doves to bring a rose in mid-flight to my son. He'll take it between his teeth before he enters the water. Then it will be perfect!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Mr. Ramier|Bob Roth|0.32037079334259| You can count on Edgar! No animal's more obedient than this sweet little pigeon.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Adrien|-0.115819096565247| Dove! They're doves!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Adrien|Bob Roth|-0.661218404769897| Hang on, I'm allergic to pigeons. If they get too close-|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Gabriel|-0.691875696182251| Nothing is gonna happen because they're doves!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Gabriel|Bob Roth|0.102204918861389| I'll give you thirty minutes to set this all up. |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Marinette|-0.694827228784561| You heard the man, Ramier. You better not let me down!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Kagami|0.423738360404968| And now, time for camouflage! |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Kagami|Marinette|0.577685356140137| Do you always carry these things with you? |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Marinette|-0.303890526294708| Of course! I have to be rea- I mean you have to be ready for any opportunity whenever you run into Adrien. Everything is retractable and folds up neatly. Even this fancy ball gown. You'll be needing it when you get back together with Adrien.Here are the swimsuits! No time to lose! |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Kagami|-0.00530338287353516|I bet you're already starting to fall in love with him again. |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Kagami|Marinette|-0.586760878562927| No.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Bob Roth|-0.583035200834274| That's just 'cause you haven't seen him in action yet.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Adrien|0.391091346740723| Action!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Adrien|Bob Roth|-0.419848680496216| Aah! |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Mr. Ramier|-0.725112020969391| Your pigeon isn't up for the job! He's not supposed to come back with the rose!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Mr. Ramier|Adrien|-0.736298412084579| The sneeze frightened him.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Adrien|Marinette|-0.600484788417816| I told you, I'm allergic to pigeons! |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Kagami|0.607901215553284| Did you see how handsome he is? Did you feel your heart beat faster? Did you get the shivers? Tingles in your fingers? |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Kagami|Marinette|-0.664616197347641| What I felt was sorry for that poor pigeon tamer.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Bob Roth|-0.496013522148132| It's because you haven't looked into each others' eyes yet! Oh! I've got an idea!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Kagami|-0.336991488933563| Here, for your allergy to the doves. |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Kagami|Marinette|-0.698612660169601| What are you doing? Put me down right now!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Bob Roth|0.371467471122742| I'm having your eyes meet. There, he's looking at you. Look at him! Look at him!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Adrien|-0.336827754974365| This cannot be happening. How complicated is to deliver a rose in mid-flight to a model in mid-dive?|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Adrien|Bob Roth|-0.601472437381744| It's my fault. I thought, I saw one of my friends from school. |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Marinette|-0.739378720521927| Well, I don't see anyone, except a stupid bird that's incapable of doing what it's been asked to do and that's gonna be get banned from all of Paris, if it continues to ruin the rehearsals for my commercial! |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Kagami|-0.249290764331818| |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Kagami|Marinette|-0.660096049308777| No Marinette, I didn't feel anything, except for shame for me, for Adrien and for this ridiculously embarrassing situation. I'm leaving.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Gabriel|-0.704107820987701| But, it's because you were too far apart. When you're close together, that you really feel it. Oh, I got an idea!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Gabriel|Bob Roth|0.597062587738037|Are you ready?|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Mr. Ramier|0.511785745620728| Of course! |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Mr. Ramier|Bob Roth|0.487059116363525|Remember Edgar, if Mr. Roth is happy he will have a word with the mayor and pigeons will live in Paris happily ever after.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Kagami|0.391091346740723| Action!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Kagami|Marinette|-0.327497720718384| Marinette, stop it! This is completely crazy!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Adrien|0.340242743492126| Love is crazy! So, stop thinking too much and dive in!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Adrien|Adrien|-0.623125314712524| Marinette?|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Adrien|Marinette|-0.565632879734039| Marinette, what on earth are you doing here?|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Adrien|0.0627059936523438| Me? Well um- I just came here to do a few laps and wind you up- I mean, unwind... How about you?|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Adrien|Marinette|-0.635574012994766| Well, we're in rehearsal for a commercial. The pool is supposed to be closed.|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Marinette|Gabriel|-0.727401167154312| To the post? Oh well, that's why there was no one at the front desk. Oh Boy, I wouldn't want to kiss you- I mean, keep you, keep you from your job. So I'll be on my way. |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Gabriel|Bob Roth|-0.755011647939682|This is a complete failure, Robert!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Mr. Ramier|-0.706358671188354| It's not my fault, it's his fault!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Mr. Ramier|Gabriel|0.0817590951919556|How dare you?! Edgar is my best friend the most intelligent and loyal pigeon there ever was!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Gabriel|Bob Roth|0.230680227279663|So, it is a pigeon!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Gabriel|-0.668085247278214| What?! This is a pigeon?! Ramier, how dare you cheat me out of the real thing?! So sorry, Gabriel, I'm gonna find a replacement immediately! I know a very good shark trainer!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Gabriel|Gabriel|-0.440445601940155|Do not disappoint me again. |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Gabriel|Bob Roth|-0.362487614154816| This commercial is turning into a fiasco, but maybe we can salvage something beneficial from it after all, my love. |4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Mr. Ramier|-0.722999006509781|You get out of my pool! You're fired!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Mr. Ramier|Bob Roth|-0.487127006053925| But you were supposed to have a word with the mayor!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72
Bob Roth|Adrien|-0.0248823165893555| You know what I'm going to tell the mayor to ban those flying rats and tamers like you now and forever!GET OUT!|4|82|Mr. Pigeon 72

A sombrero? No problem-o. But a derby?! You know what? It won’t even matter, 'cause I’ll probably make a total fool of myself at the event, most likely trip over my stupid derby and collapse on Mr. Agreste; give him a full-blown concussion and Adrien will hate me! I'll never be a world-renowned fashion designer. MY LIFE IS OVER!|1|6|Mr. Pigeon

Marinette|Alya|-0.612575769424438| What? |1|6|Mr. Pigeon
Alya|Marinette|-0.332232713699341| But, it's the same as Chloé's.|1|6|Mr. Pigeon
Marinette|Chloé|-0.612575769424438| What?! |1|6|Mr. Pigeon
Chloé|Marinette|0.147987604141235| Uh, hi Mr. Agreste. I'm Chloé Bourgeois. You know my father, André Bourgeois, the mayor?|1|6|Mr. Pigeon
Marinette|Alya|-0.68994927406311| Ugh, that thieving little brat!|1|6|Mr. Pigeon

Gabriel|Chloé|-0.34444785118103| Hm, turn the tablet back to Ms. Bourgeois' hat.Is this a joke?|1|6|Mr. Pigeon
Chloé|Marinette|-0.758952528238297| No fair! Marinette copied my design! It's scandalous, how could you do that? |1|6|Mr. Pigeon
Marinette|Gabriel|-0.35613739490509| I apologize for the situation Mr. Agreste, but I can prove that this derby hat is MY original design.|1|6|Mr. Pigeon
Gabriel|Marinette|0.57536506652832| Go ahead.|1|6|Mr. Pigeon
Marinette|Chloé|0.464019894599915| Um, everything on my derby hat is hand-made from the embroidery, to the weaving of the band, to the stitching of the brim.All done by myself. And last, there's a special design element that only the true designer knows about: I signed mine. |1|6|Mr. Pigeon
Chloé|Gabriel|-0.0828880071640015| Daddy!|1|6|Mr. Pigeon
Gabriel|Adrien|0.595977663993835| Very exquisite creation. You definitely have the laboring hands of a hat maker, miss...|1|6|Mr. Pigeon

Tikki|Plagg|0.338846206665039| Perhaps we should help them?|3|59|Oblivio
Plagg|Plagg|0.395979404449463| Well, I'm not going anywhere until I know what smells so good in that Boy's shirt. |3|59|Oblivio

Adrien|Plagg|-0.654583930969238| Not to mention the two strange creatures who magically appeared when our costumes disappeared. |3|59|Oblivio
Plagg|Adrien|-0.120068371295929| Uh, excuse me, but the creatures are hungry. Would you mind opening up your shirt to see what smells so good?|3|59|Oblivio

Adrien|Marinette|0.14343798160553| We can hide out here while we signal for help. |3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Adrien|-0.709652155637741| Good idea!Ugh! No handle! And the glass is tinted.They won't be able to see us.|3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Marinette|-0.237956523895264|Phone lines are down.If only I could remember how to unlock my phone. |3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Adrien|-0.131323277950287| Wait! |3|59|Oblivio

Marinette|Adrien|-0.693716078996658|I'm almost out of battery.|3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Gabriel|0.0711909532546997|Me too. We should call our parents first.Gabriel Agreste. Probably… my dad. |3|59|Oblivio
Gabriel|Adrien|0.277003049850464|This is Gabriel Agreste's voicemail. To leave a message, please call my secretary. |3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Marinette|0.350550651550293|Let's hope you have better luck than me.|3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Sabine|0.111370921134949|Agreste, Césaire, Couffaine, Dupain-Cheng, Sabine! |3|59|Oblivio
Sabine|Marinette|-0.361783146858215|Marinette, are you okay? They're saying on TV that Ladybug and Cat Noir are battling a supervillain at the Montparnasse Tower!Isn't that where you were going on your school trip today?|3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Sabine|0.0189281702041626|Cat Noir and... Ladybug..?|3|59|Oblivio
Sabine|Marinette|-0.155788600444794| Marinette, is everything okay? Where are you?|3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Sabine|0.0296916961669922| Uh, sure, Mom, everything's okay. I'm with my friend, safe. Don't worry.|3|59|Oblivio
Sabine|Marinette|-0.610834449529648| I'm so relieved! Whatever you do, stay there until the supervillain's been defeated. |3|59|Oblivio

Adrien|Marinette|0.0414543151855469| Why didn't you ask her for help?|3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Adrien|-0.591922968626022|I have both good news and bad news. The good news is: there are superheroes in the tower that will stop that supervillain. The bad news is: we're the superheroes! And the thing that's chasing us is the supervillain! And we're supposed to be defeating it with superpowers we no longer have! |3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Hawk Moth|-0.565250426530838|Eh...|3|59|Oblivio
Hawk Moth|Marinette|-0.558432370424271| Nobody? We must have missed something.They have to be inside the building, Oblivio. Ladybug and Cat Noir can't have escaped. Retrace your steps. They must have transformed back by now. And with their memories erased, you won't have any trouble getting your hands on their Miraculous.|3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Adrien|-0.425398349761963| If my own mother doesn't know that I'm Ladybug, then nobody must know. |3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Marinette|0.475585341453552| What about us? Do you think… we know?|3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Adrien|0.0798161029815674| Hm.I feel like we're more than just a superhero team. |3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Marinette|0.102479696273804|Do you think we're… |3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Adrien|0.398019433021545| Looks like it. |3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Marinette|-0.376363396644592| Then we must have told each other everything. I couldn't hide my identity from the girl I love. |3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Adrien|0.272541642189026| So, if we're the superheroes, then what are they? |3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Tikki|-0.528170168399811| I have no idea.|3|59|Oblivio
Tikki|Plagg|-0.668189108371735| You can't just leave, we have to help them!|3|59|Oblivio
Plagg|Tikki|-0.691794842481613| We don't even know who we are, or who they are. I don't want to help out a couple of strangers. |3|59|Oblivio
Tikki|Plagg|-0.703567624092102| You may not remember who you are, but at least you know this about this about yourself: you're a selfish being, and a total coward! |3|59|Oblivio
Plagg|Adrien|-0.674877792596817| Me, a coward?I am not a coward! I—I'm a free spirit, so don't come if you don't want to, but I'm out of here! |3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Tikki|-0.287477552890778|Did he go to get help?|3|59|Oblivio
Tikki|Oblivio|-0.693384051322937| I don't think we should hold our breath.|3|59|Oblivio
Oblivio|Oblivio|-0.0165963768959045| Ladybug, Cat Noir, we know you're in here. You won't get away this time. |3|59|Oblivio
Oblivio|Adrien|-0.145230948925018| You remember your BFF Oblivio, don't you? Don't tell us you've forgotten us. Ha ha ha ha! |3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Marinette|0.439823865890503|I'm not convinced that this monster is really our best friend.|3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Adrien|-0.613245189189911|One thing's for sure, if we're superheroes, he can't find out about our secret identities.|3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Marinette|-0.352721571922302| How about some kind of diversion? We get out of here and take the emergency stairs.|3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Marinette|-0.179963231086731| Sorry, I need this. |3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Adrien|0.454176664352417|I'll call you, and when he comes, we make a run for it.I'll use the tape to pull your phone back. Ready?|3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Oblivio|0.333396077156067| No wonder I fell in love with you. |3|59|Oblivio
Oblivio|Oblivio|-0.794898718595505| Uh uh. Gotcha.You shouldn't have forgotten to switch off your phone.Nooo! |3|59|Oblivio
Oblivio|Marinette|-0.756763219833374| You're trying to fool Oblivio again! But it's not gonna work this time.Or perhaps we give you too much credit. |3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Adrien|0.620332598686218| You saved our lives! Thank you. |3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Plagg|0.3404301404953|Let's head back to where we were. It's the last place he'll think of looking for us. |3|59|Oblivio
Plagg|Marinette|-0.57732567191124| Pfft, a coward, me? Whatever! Huh?Adrien?I may not remember my own name, but I know for a fact that I'm brave andI… am…This is called psychological harassment!|3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Adrien|-0.787849098443985| Sorry, your phone's out of juice. |3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Tikki|-0.294784188270569|No worries. We’re doing pretty well, even without powers, don't you think?|3|59|Oblivio
Tikki|Marinette|0.725132346153259| It's true, you two make a very effective couple. |3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Pedestrian|-0.44856870174408| Yes, but if we want a real shot at defeating this villain, we're gonna have to become Ladybug and Cat Noir again.Maybe we can gather some hints by watching some news footage to see what happened before he erased our memories.|3|59|Oblivio
Pedestrian|Roger|0.61064612865448| Hey, do something!|3|59|Oblivio
Roger|Pedestrian|-0.0643956661224365| What do you want me to do?|3|59|Oblivio
Pedestrian|Roger|-0.36393004655838| I don't know, you're the cop!|3|59|Oblivio
Roger|TVi Person|0.0339276790618896| I am? |3|59|Oblivio
TVi Person|Nadja|0.33719801902771| Nadja, you're on the air!|3|59|Oblivio
Nadja|Adrien|-0.550584137439728| Me? What do I do?Uh, don't be bemused, it's just the news. Since early this afternoon, a supervillain by the name of Oblivio has been erasing the memories of everyone he comes across. Ladybug and Cat Noir are tracking him down inside Montparnasse Tower. |3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Hawk Moth|0.222957372665405| Well, right now, he's the one tracking us down.|3|59|Oblivio
Hawk Moth|Oblivio|-0.517792105674744|Ladybug and Cat Noir are toying with you Oblivio. If you can't manage to find them…|3|59|Oblivio
Oblivio|Nadja|-0.295604526996613|Then we'll flush them out of hiding, Hawk Moth! |3|59|Oblivio
Nadja|Ladybug|-0.393087804317474|Looks like Ladybug and Cat Noir are struggling today. |3|59|Oblivio
Ladybug|Adrien|-0.596048384904861| And stop calling us a couple!|3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Marinette|-0.680355936288834| We don't exactly look lovey-dovey in this footage.|3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Nadja|-0.637941718101501| Probably just a regular fight like all couples have.|3|59|Oblivio
Nadja|Marinette|-0.689456045627594| The battle against Oblivio continues.Oh, oh no! Cat Noir has been hit, but Ladybug pulls him out of danger.What's she doing now?Ladybug is down, too!|3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Adrien|0.379829883575439| The drawing! There was a drawing on the elevator wall! I remember now. It was a turtle. I saw it earlier when I was looking for my mom's number.There it is! |3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Master Fu|-0.315566003322601| You left yourself a message! So smart. |3|59|Oblivio
Master Fu|Marinette|0.0623084306716919| Hello?|3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Fu|-0.53339084982872|Mr. Turtle? |3|59|Oblivio
Fu|Marinette|-0.713415890932083| Marinette, is there a problem? |3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Fu|-0.214625537395477| Listen. I can’t remember who I am or who you are. Oblivio has erased my memory. But I think I'm supposed to call you.|3|59|Oblivio
Fu|Marinette|-0.155383706092834| You did the right thing. Is Cat Noir with you? |3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Fu|-0.33576887845993|Yeah, well Adrien, actually.|3|59|Oblivio
Fu|Adrien|0.0847529172897339| You two know your true identities, then. |3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Fu|-0.6077641248703| We're not supposed to?|3|59|Oblivio
Fu|Marinette|-0.578875154256821| That's okay, the Miraculous Ladybugs will repair everything anyway. |3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Fu|-0.299105048179626| We figured out we're superheroes, but we don't know how to make ourselves Ladybug and Cat Noir again.Mr. Turtle, you'll have to tell us quick, I'm almost out of battery.|3|59|Oblivio
Fu|Marinette|0.289836287498474| Are your kwamis with you? |3|59|Oblivio
Marinette|Fu|-0.293858230113983| Uh, if you mean the flying creatures, then, one of them. The red one is with us.|3|59|Oblivio
Fu|Adrien|0.0783600807189941| Okay. Listen carefully, the red kwami's name is Tikki.She gives you your powersSay, \Tikki, spots on,\ and you'll transform into Ladybug. You'll find an emergency user's guide in your bug phone. Adrien, your kwami's the black one. His name is Plagg.Tell him, \Plagg, claws out,\ and you'll become Cat Noir again. The rest is in your cat phone.|3|59|Oblivio
Adrien|Fu|-0.732461303472519| But, my kwami took off.|3|59|Oblivio

"Nathalie"|0.356841325759888|" Brilliant. But how do you plan to do that?"|4|88|"Optigami"

"Marinette"|-0.60377162694931|" Of course I should've known Chloé was behind this! We're gonna have to break this curse, Rose!"|1|19|"Reflekta"
"Rose"|0.496509432792664|" We can ask the photographer."|1|19|"Reflekta"
"Marinette"|-0.484157919883728|" There's no point, he wouldn't want to! Unless, the photo disappeared, and the principal would have no choice but ask the photographer to shoot another one, with Juleka!"|1|19|"Reflekta"
"Rose"|-0.715651541948318|" You're a genius, Marinette! But why would the photo just disappear?"|1|19|"Reflekta"

"Marinette"|0.323730826377869|"Alya, I wanted to ask you something."|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Alya"|0.606662750244141|" Ah, you noticed! It's crazy how my costume automatically adapted to my new role. And it gave me the idea for my new name - Rena Furtive!"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Marinette"|-0.237590909004211|" Cool, yes, but secret. We agreed that officially the Miraculous of the Fox doesn't have a holder anymore. Alya, you did tell Nino that you would never be Rena Rouge again, right?"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Alya"|0.375087857246399|" Well, it's just..."|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Marinette"|-0.239783704280853|" Alya! Everyone has to believe that you can never use a Miraculous again. That way, you can be our spy without anyone suspecting."|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Alya"|0.494545698165894|"And cover you with my power of illusion if Shadow Moth has you followed or if he ever shows himself, I can follow him. I know, I know. "|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Marinette"|-0.33027845621109|" For the plan to work, no one can know about it. And no one means no one. Even Nino has to believe that you'll never be Rena Rouge again!"|4|90|"Rocketear"

"Nino"|-0.612575769424438|"What?"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Alya"|-0.62713423371315|"Uh, I, uh...,I can't do this, it's too hard."|4|90|"Rocketear"

"Nino"|-0.128502309322357|" What is it, then?"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Alya"|-0.277708947658539|"Nino, it's about our superhero secrets. Ladybug and I had a chat and... Okay. I'm no longer Rena Rouge and I never will be. Ladybug won't give me a Miraculous ever again, she thinks it's become too dangerous."|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Nino"|-0.506150245666504|" That all makes sense. It was so weird you're not being there with us last time. Well, it's a super bummer for sure but if Ladybug thinks it's better for you,why are you so scared to tell me? You know we can share everything and nothing will ever change that."|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Alya"|0.741463184356689|" Yeah, we can share everything."|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Marinette"|-0.411637544631958|"You did the right thing. It's safer to protect our secrets."|4|90|"Rocketear"

I took a few selfies with my new costume. There are tons of details I'm sure you missed. Check this out!Right by the neckline, isn't it way cool?"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Marinette"|-0.557039171457291|"Alya..."|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Alya"|-0.348578035831451|" I think I like it better than the old one. Oh, what if I did a survey on the Ladyblog and let people vote on their favorite?"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Marinette"|-0.294391393661499|"Alya, Rena Furtive means Rena Invisible. No one can ever see these."|4|90|"Rocketear"

"Nino"|-0.153954923152924|"Did you see the video?"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Adrien"|-0.262364268302917|" Come on, that's just some video from the Ladyblog, not proof."|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Nino"|0.331128239631653|"I'll find proof, then you'll see that I was right! "|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Adrien"|-0.567607790231705|"There's no way! "|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Plagg"|-0.270912528038025|" Oh, there's a way. Yes way! My natural charisma has probably just rubbed off on you."|4|90|"Rocketear"

There I was, with my old buddies again: the city, the night, the solitude, the rain, pouring down,not like the tears that were stuck in my throat.It was time to end all the lies and secrets.

"Cat Noir"|-0.622322976589203|" No, no! Everything's fine! It's just that I saw you posted a new video about me. I'm super flattered, really, but it made me wonder: you've been following Ladybug and me from the very start. You take photos and videos, and we even saved you a couple times. What I mean is, we're starting to know each other pretty well and... it's made me notice a couple of small things. I hope I'm just under the illusion that there's something but uh..."|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Alya"|-0.365310192108154|" Illusion...? What illusion? What small things?"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Cat Noir"|-0.398336470127106|"It's kind of hard to explain, but I wanted to make sure that in all this time you've spent admiring me, you haven't built up some kind of uh... feelings for me. I mean, I get it, \Hey, I am the Cat's Meow.\"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Alya"|0.578724503517151|" Huh, what feelings for you?"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Cat Noir"|0.260747671127319|" Well.. you know.. "|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Alya"|-0.575627148151398|"Are you insane?! I already have a Boyfriend! And FYI, with him it's not just,it's more like "|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Cat Noir"|-0.692867428064346|"Sorry, that was so silly of me."|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Alya"|-0.0480307936668396|" Sorry, Cat Noir, but my Nino is a thousand times more irresistible than you. "|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Alya"|-0.591526746749878|" Besides, I don't really know your real identity, and I could never fall for someone I didn't really know."|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Adrien"|0.243547439575195|" Oh, hey, Nino! I gotta tell you something."|4|90|"Rocketear"

"Nino"|-0.181603848934174|"Sit down!"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Adrien"|-0.0214594006538391|" Uh... when did you set all this up?"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Nino"|0.0961059331893921|" I'm the one asking questions! Remember what I told you yesterday? I got proof now. What do you say to this?! "|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Adrien"|-0.727911025285721|"Uh-Come on, that doesn't make any sense. You're wrong, that's not at all what happened!"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Nino"|0.430760145187378|" How do you know? You were there? You're in on it too?!"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Adrien"|-0.517356753349304|" No, no. Of course, not! But it's impossible! I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding. Alya and Cat Noir have nothing in common. They barely know each other! Alya is just a superhero fan she's been filming Ladybug and Cat Noir, that's all!"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Nino"|0.720565915107727|" They know each other well enough!"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Adrien"|-0.271602809429169|" But no one knows Ladybug and Cat Noir's secret identities. Can you imagine Alya falling in love with someone she doesn't really know? The girl who wants to be a reporter who always wants to know the truth, no matter what? Who wants to share everything with the Boy she loves?"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Nino"|0.488782167434692|"They actually know each other much better than you think!"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Adrien"|-0.438211143016815|" You can't assume that from this video."|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Nino"|-0.000674247741699219|" Listen, here's what you don't know! I'm not talking about the video, dude. I'm talking about something I shouldn't be telling you. A mind-blowing secret. Alya is a superhero. She's Rena Rouge!"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Adrien"|-0.612575769424438|" What?!"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Nino"|-0.276519358158112|" Shh!I know what you're about to say: \That's nonsense and how would Nino know that anyway?\ I know because... I'm a superhero too. I'm Carapace!"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Adrien"|0.0263868570327759|" Huh? You're... Carapace? But... the two of you know?! You know each other's secret identities?!"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Nino"|-0.0628336071968079|" Of course, Alya and I have never kept anything from each other. Until now, though that Cat Noir's business!"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Adrien"|-0.469806253910065|" Wait a sec, I don't understand! I thought that secret identities had to be protected at all costs. If it were true, you'd never just tell me like that. Ladybug would never agree to that!"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Nino"|0.432731866836548|" Are you kidding? Ladybug is the one who gave us both our Miraculous at the same time."|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Adrien"|-0.637702405452728|"No, that's impossible! "|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Nino"|-0.688838690519333|" What are you trying to say? That I'm lying or something!?"|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Adrien"|-0.581117153167725|" No, no. What I meant was- Okay, you're Carapace, she's Rena Rouge and Ladybug's okay with this. But it still isn't like Alya or Cat Noir to be...you know...? "|4|90|"Rocketear"
"Nino"|-0.0374793410301208|" You don't know what Cat Noir really is but I do! I'm part of the team! I see how he acts in real life. Sure, as soon as Ladybug shows up, he throws himself at her feet with roses and big declarations,but he gets blown off every time, because Ladybug thinks he's obnoxious, and she's right! And then whenever Rena Rouge shows up, it's like,\Why, hello there, pretty lady, you look so fine! You smell so good!\ So yeah, it's easy to figure out that the first mission I missed- I mean, Carapace missed, he made his move and, BAM! This is what happened. Now,I'm all alone. I've lost the love of my life.If I could, I'd sew his sweet talking mouth shut with his own whiskers! "|4|90|"Rocketear"

"Marinette"|-0.715506166219711|" Nope! Chloé's the one calling people thieves without any proof. I'm simply going from what's on the video."|1|8|"Rogercop"

"Marinette"|-0.70037430524826|" And nether did I! But when it comes down to it, Chloé can accuse anyone and everyone!"|1|8|"Rogercop"
"Chloé"|-0.432295680046082|" Fine! Since you're a suspect, you'll have no problem letting me search your bag!"|1|8|"Rogercop"

"Cat Noir"|-0.568013310432434|"As Rogercop would say, \Justice has prevailed in the streets of Paris!\I'd stick around, but then you'd see me without my mask and... you wouldn't be able to resist me."|1|8|"Rogercop"

"Chloé"|-0.2514368891716|" My bag!My bracelet! But... how?"|1|8|"Rogercop"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|0.340266704559326|" Roger! You found the bracelet?"|1|8|"Rogercop"
"Roger"|-0.467140853404999|" Actually it turns out it was in Chloé's bag all along! Must've fallen into a side pocket when that girl tripped over it."|1|8|"Rogercop"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|-0.749510645866394|" Well, Roger, I do apologize for being so accusatory, and firing you for no good reason."|1|8|"Rogercop"
"Ladybug"|0.259030103683472|" I think Officer Roger has proven his excellence to you, Mr. Mayor. You'd be wrong not to keep him on."|1|8|"Rogercop"
"Mr. Bourgeois"|0.185880661010742|" Of course, Ladybug! You're absolutely right. And actually, it's Lieutenant Roger now."|1|8|"Rogercop"
"Roger"|0.636710524559021|" Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'm proud to be on the force, and I vow to uphold my firm belief that every citizen is innocent until proven guilty."|1|8|"Rogercop"

"Chloé"|-0.709675341844559|" Ugh! Yes, daddy."|1|8|"Rogercop"
"Ladybug"|-0.509801208972931|" Lesson learned! "|1|8|"Rogercop"
"Marinette's phone"|0.627277255058289|" Check out the hilarious new cat memes featuring Cat Noir. They're purr-fect."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Marinette"|-0.153436660766602|"You're so flighty tonight, Tikki. Whatcha got your mind on?"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|0.096297025680542|" The kwami Nooroo's transmission is…"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Marinette"|-0.415968000888824|"Hawk Moth's kwami?"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|0.58716881275177|" Yes. He's celebrating his thirty-five hundredth cycle today… all by himself."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Marinette"|0.066283106803894|" We will free him from Hawk Moth one of these days, I promise."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|-0.11413586139679|" There may just be a faster solution."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Marinette"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|0.179068565368652|" Kwamis are able to communicate with their kind on their cycle, or birthday. But we won't get another opportunity for a long time. See? A kwami's cycle lasts several hundreds of human years."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Marinette"|0.602280616760254|" Wow! That's amazing! Then… you could find out where he is. But… how would you do that?"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|0.357329964637756|" The kwamis must gather in the Miracle Box at a specific time."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Marinette"|0.211261391639709|" When would that be?"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|0.370535254478455|" Tonight."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Marinette"|-0.0797891616821289|" Tonight?! Why didn't you tell me about this sooner, Tikki?!"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|-0.729903399944305|" Because Master Fu doesn't want us kwamis to leave our owner's sides. He says we have to be able to take action immediately if someone becomes akumatized."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Marinette"|-0.198506295681|" Hmm… he's right. But surely it's no big deal, I mean… if all the other kwamis are able to meet up, then it's still gonna happen, right?"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|-0.318101346492767|" Well, I'm afraid it might not work if I don't go. The more kwamis that are present, the better chance we have of succeeding!"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Marinette"|-0.653635114431381|" But, if Master Fu doesn't approve…"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|0.576613187789917|" Wayzz, Plagg and I have an idea; well, it was mainly Plagg's idea.Plagg and I would go and gather with other kwamis inside the Miracle Box. Wayzz would stand guard and he'd let us know right away if anyone becomes akumatized.What do you think?"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Marinette"|0.464351773262024|" That's a great idea! There is no risk if Wayzz is keeping a look out."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|-0.558683007955551|" Even if we don't tell Master Fu the whole truth?"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Marinette"|-0.415197372436523|" If it means we're able to save Nooroo and defeat Hawk Moth, Master Fu won't be able to hold it against you."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|0.0419192314147949|" So you're okay with it? You'll let me go?"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Marinette"|0.507157444953918|" Yes, I trust you Tikki."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|0.178869366645813|" Oh, thank you, Marinette! You don't have to worry, I won't let you down.Sweet dreams! "|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Plagg"|-0.710897147655487|"I am exhausted. I'm off to bed."|2|45|"Sandboy"

"Nooroo"|-0.18186342716217|" I just wanted to go out… just for a little while."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Gabriel"|-0.652161866426468|" No, you know the rules. You're not allowed to be more than a few feet away from me and no communicating with anyone besides me. There are no exceptions. "|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Nooroo"|0.00271761417388916|" But, Master, it's my birthday today. I thought—"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Gabriel"|-0.736742317676544|" You obviously haven't grasped the rules, Nooroo. We're going to have to make them even simpler. From now on you won't be able to communicate. At all."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Nooroo"|-0.0418905019760132|" But, Master— "|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Gabriel"|-0.727289855480194|" Huh, it was a joke, Nooroo. I'm not that cruel. "|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Nooroo"|0.64166784286499|"Thank you, Master."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Gabriel"|-0.572946786880493|"Change of plans, Nooroo."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Hawk Moth"|0.583896279335022|" I feel an emotion of great intensity. So pure…Fly away my little Akuma and evilize him!"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Plagg"|0.3187415599823|" Hey, Sugarcube!"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|-0.713712602853775|" Ugh. I've already told not to call me that. Do you ever hear me calling you \Stinky Sock\?"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Plagg"|-0.414741098880768|" No, but you should! That would be delightful, Sugarcube!So, what lies did you tell your owner in order to sneak out tonight?"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|-0.0245690941810608|" Actually, I just told her the honest truth."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Plagg"|0.645511031150818|" Oh? Maybe I should try that someday; see what it's like. "|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|0.132249236106873|" Plagg! You should've saved some for the others."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Plagg"|-0.632796943187714|" True, but I was so grossed out by your kindness that it made me really hungry."|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|0.626733303070068|"I hope we can get in contact with Nooroo…"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Plagg"|0.585109353065491|" So do I. "|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Tikki"|-0.597080290317535|" Are you crying?"|2|45|"Sandboy"
"Plagg"|-0.64137989282608|"Who me? O-of course not! Are you kidding? Come on, let's race! The last one there won't get any cheese!"|2|45|"Sandboy"

"Wayzz"|0.598827958106995|" Sssshhh! You'll wake up Master!Psst, come on.If you manage to contact Nooroo, wish him a happy thirty-five hundred cycles for me."|2|45|"Sandboy"

My only explanation, my speculation, is that some supervillain is after Adrien. It's a good thing I'm here, I'll protect him without fear, this Boy that I secretly love. Now with all of my might, I'll save you tonight, you're the boy that I secretly love. If you'll never know it's true, I'll be there for you, you're the boy that I secretly love.

"Ella and Etta"|0.0990580320358276|" The amusement park! "|2|37|"Sapotis"
"Alya"|0.379197597503662|" That's what I thought. So, goodnight, Sapotis. "|2|37|"Sapotis"
"Ella"|0.226069450378418|" Wait! Can we keep 'em on? Please?"|2|37|"Sapotis"
"Alya"|0.364926099777222|" All right. But go to sleep now. "|2|37|"Sapotis"

"Alya"|-0.095704197883606|" The Sapotis? They're little monsters from a créole fable... who are always pulling pranks and making all sorts of mischief.Now that we're all alone I can finally tell you.Apparently Ladybug has been around at least since the pharaohs. But no way can the Ladybug we know can be five thousand years old! So, I downloaded a great app that analyzed some recordings I had of her talking. Based on the frequencies of her voice, it turns out she's a girl our age!"|2|37|"Sapotis"

"Alya"|0.514295935630798|" Oh, yeah! Ladybug! She's like a high school girl. So to figure out who she really is, all we need to do is to find a girl our age who's always late—"|2|37|"Sapotis"
"Marinette"|-0.181678831577301|"Don't you think there's a reason why she keeps her identity a secret?"|2|37|"Sapotis"
"Alya"|0.242712020874023|"All right, that's enough! Get out of bed one more time, and no one'll be going to the amusement park tomorrow!"|2|37|"Sapotis"

"Ella and Etta"|0.635285019874573|" 'And do whatever we want? Like, stay up all night! And go to the movies? And eat lots of desserts? And drink orange juice?! And still go to the amusement park?!"|2|37|"Sapotis"
"Hawk Moth"|-0.633990883827209|" Yes, yes, but calm down! From now on, no one will ever be able to punish you, because it will always be another Sapoti's fault. All you have to do is to take Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous, and give them to your good friend, Hawk Moth. Okay?"|2|37|"Sapotis"
"Ella and Etta"|0.48602294921875|" Okay! "|2|37|"Sapotis"

"Wayzz"|-0.560151398181915|" Hmm?"|2|37|"Sapotis"
"Master Fu"|0.236740112304688|" Marinette, I taught you all about the Miraculous and their powers. You know that yours works in a very mysterious way.

"Marinette"|-0.234419465065002|" And you were right to do it. Cat Noir and I are very careful."|2|37|"Sapotis"

"Master Fu"|0.168999910354614|" Yes. Once the mission is over, you must retrieve the Miraculous from them and bring it back to me. Until we've unlocked all the secrets of the spellbook, it's too dangerous to allow any more Miraculous to be out in the open for very long."|2|37|"Sapotis"

Once she's given you the Miraculous, the Sentibubbler will be hiding nearby and capture Ladybug!"|4|89|"Sentibubbler"
"Alya"|-0.435474038124084|" Cat Noir will come to save her!"|4|89|"Sentibubbler"
"Shadow Moth"|-0.107798755168915|" No. He won't even know she's been captured. Because thanks to your Miraculous, you'll transform into Rena Rouge and create an illusion of Ladybug and Rena Rouge to distract Cat Noir. Thinking he's joined his fellow heroes, he won't notice the Sentibubbler until it's too late, and you'll give me your Miraculous! It is then and only then when the three Miraculous are finally in my possession! That, the Sentibubbler will release your loved ones. If you try anything to warn Ladybug or Cat Noir, I'll order the Sentibubbler to send the bubbles into space, too far for any superhero to ever save them!"|4|89|"Sentibubbler"

"Bob"|0.155971646308899|" Never mind. No one will know the difference anyway. Image is key. What kind of visuals you got going? Any concepts?"|3|58|"Silencer"
"XY"|-0.524036735296249|" Any what?"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Bob"|0.0541051626205444|" Forget it. I'll use the same plan that's made me the rich man I am today. If you're short on great ideas, borrow someone else's. "|3|58|"Silencer"
"Bob"|0.550294280052185|" We're looking for new talent. Stunning musical and visual skills are a must. With a brand new style that everyone will die for. You have two weeks to send in your videos. "|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|0.753347873687744|" It's a perfect opportunity to showcase Kitty Section."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Luka"|0.558890104293823|" And the stage clothes you designed, Marinette."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|0.638680219650269|"If we all pitch in, two weeks is more than enough time to make an awesome video. Everyone in?"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Rose"|0.437131643295288|" Here we go!"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Everyone"|-0.559089779853821|" Kitty Section!"|3|58|"Silencer"

"Luka"|0.259410619735718|" Wow! This is so awesome! We're so in the moment. The song's fun and totally sincere.Hey, Marinette. Still no news about the contest?"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|-0.751070007681847|" Maybe they didn't like our song?"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Luka"|0.0597331523895264|" They must've received a ton of videos. They probably haven't made their pick yet."|3|58|"Silencer"

"XY"|0.717112183570862|"...cause I love my unicorn, and fluffy blue bunnies, too! "|3|58|"Silencer"
"Alec"|0.581189155578613|" Wow! Lovin' the new look, XY! You've really outdone yourself this time. How did you come up with a style that's so... original?"|3|58|"Silencer"
"XY"|0.373402237892151|"It's all in here."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Ivan"|0.0296299457550049|" But that's our original style!"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Luka"|0.249431610107422|"Your unicorn, and your mask!"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|-0.483339309692383|"That's your melody.It's your music. That's not fair! That should be you guys up there on TV. There better be a good explanation. We have to have it out with Bob Roth and XY."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Guard 1"|-0.426108956336975|" They're not here right now."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|0.509992718696594|" Seriously? They're right there on live screen."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Guard 1"|-0.679507195949554|" You're not allowed in. You don't have an invitation and the show already started."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|-0.343232750892639|" But it's our show!"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Guard 2"|-0.642861038446426|" Not our problem, miss."|3|58|"Silencer"

"Alec"|0.624958992004395|" Wow! Awesome, XY! Such a 180 from your last record! This might be your best yet! So tell me, where did you get the inspiration for all this new material?"|3|58|"Silencer"
"XY"|-0.470758616924286|" Oh, it's nothing really. I came up with the whole song in 5 minutes."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Luka"|-0.719310492277145|" In 5 minutes? He couldn't even sing it the way it's supposed to be sung. "|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|-0.569042176008224|" And his mask isn't even a good rip-off.Mr. Roth! My name's Marinette Dupain-Cheng. I'm the one who sent you the Kitty Section video."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Bob"|-0.254842877388|" Video? What video? I don't know what you're talking about, kid."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|0.575066328048706|" Maybe I can jog your memory? Look!The costumes, the mask, the music, the dance moves. They're all the same!"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Bob"|0.241231918334961|" There's no comparison. This here is some amateur garage band. My son is a solo artist. You guys play instruments, his music is all digital. Our unicorn is much cooler, and our masks are nothing like yours."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Luka"|-0.704363018274307|" That's not true! You copied Marinette's costumes!"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|-0.368138194084167|" And it's the exact same song. You stole Luka's music!"|3|58|"Silencer"
"XY"|-0.111161112785339|" Oh, come on. Let's not exaggerate now. We may have just been a little bit... inspired, that's all. "|3|58|"Silencer"
"Luka"|-0.382327318191528|"Inspired?! You flat out stole! You didn't design this mask,Marinette did!"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|-0.117303609848022|" Listen, it's not too late to do the right thing. Just tell the truth and let Kitty Section appear on the show. That's all we're asking."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Bob"|-0.164294064044952|" Yeah. First they'll wanna be in the show. Then they'll be asking for a cut of the profits. No way! Never saw or heard of Kitten Division."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Luka"|-0.612120419740677|" Forget it, Marinette. It's no big deal. Let's just go."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|-0.699706703424454|" No! It's not fair! I won't stand by and let my friends' work get stolen.If you won't tell the truth, then I will! Right now, on the air, live! "|3|58|"Silencer"
"Bob"|-0.559477090835571|"If you do that, I'll tell them you're the copycats, not me. I've got all the music biz eating out of my hand. So who do you think they're gonna believe? Me, or a group of nobodies?"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Luka"|-0.79955105483532|" Grrr..."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Bob"|-0.743499904870987|" You'll never have a future in this business. You'll never make another costume. And there'll be no more music for your buddies because as far as everyone's concerned, you'll be the rip-off artists."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Luka"|-0.79955105483532|" Grrr... "|3|58|"Silencer"
"Hawk Moth"|-0.45406711101532|" Ah. I'm detecting the echo of a very rare emotion. The anger of a creator whose work has been stolen. Who also cannot bear to see the one he loves suffer.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize this pure soul."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Bob"|-0.60953214764595|"Not quite so cocky now, are we? "|3|58|"Silencer"
"Hawk Moth"|-0.0651665925979614|"Silencer, I am Hawk Moth. This man is the voice of evil. I'm giving you the power to silence him for good. All I ask of you in return are Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous. Do we have an agreement, Silencer?"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Luka"|-0.249290764331818|" "|3|58|"Silencer"
"Hawk Moth"|-0.554090470075607|"I'll take your silence as a yes. "|3|58|"Silencer"
"XY"|-0.20666116476059|"Do you have any idea how much work it took me to copy your costumes?"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Silencer"|-0.665076166391373|"Shh. "|3|58|"Silencer"
"Bob"|-0.283884286880493|"What's that? "|3|58|"Silencer"
"Silencer"|-0.336017489433289|"Don't worry, Marinette. I would never hurt you. I will use the power Hawk Moth has given me to restore justice. I will force Bob Roth to admit what he has done to you and Kitty Section."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|-0.62105792760849|" Don't do that, Luka. That's revenge, not justice. And if you team up with Hawk Moth, you'll have to face Cat Noir and Ladybug."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Silencer"|0.693853139877319|" Cat Noir and Ladybug? Where were they when we needed them? As now, Silencer is laying down the law of silence.You’re the most extraordinary girl, Marinette. Clear as a musical note and as sincere as a melody. You’re the music that’s been playing inside my head since the day we first met. I won’t let anything happen to you. "|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|-0.574291080236435|" Wha!? "|3|58|"Silencer"
"Tikki"|0.492468357086182|" Did that sound like a declaration of love to you?"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|-0.256089806556702|" I think so. Which is kind of weird coming from a villain."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Tikki"|0.123613119125366|" Perhaps Luka feels the same way."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|-0.466527462005615|"Do you think!? Uh, stay focused, Marinette!"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Marinette"|-0.499254763126373|" Tikki, spots on! Ah!"|3|58|"Silencer"
"Silencer"|-0.138073980808258|" You can't get away from me, Bob Roth. I will make you tell the truth, live on TV."|3|58|"Silencer"

"Ladybug"|-0.667619913816452|" I can't let you do this, Silencer. "|3|58|"Silencer"

"Ladybug"|-0.71151214838028|"Listen, Lukaer, Silencer. You don't know what you're doing. Hawk Moth is evil. You think you're using your power for good but you're wrong. "|3|58|"Silencer"

I can't call out my Lucky Charm or say Miraculous Ladybug. Ah, you've definitely got a point there. The magic ladybugs won't be able to fix up all the damage caused by Silencer.And you can't say the detransformation words? Which means you'll be a mute Ladybug for the rest of your life?But it has its advantages in a way. Now you'll never be able to pick on my jokes.I'm kidding, M'lady. Don't worry, you always get us out of the worst fixes.Meanwhile, I'll be able to babble to my heart's content. "|3|58|"Silencer"

"Marinette"|-0.651622653007507|" Uh, oh, nothing. It was nothing at all. You were possessed by Hawk Moth's akuma."|3|58|"Silencer"
"Luka"|0.478679537773132|" I don't know what I possibly could've said. I just hope it wasn't anything mean. Because you're the most extraordinary girl, Marinette.

"Alec"|0.704445719718933|" So Nino, you're a student and a DJ. That's pretty awesome! Check out the decks we got for you!"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Marinette"|-0.616696029901505|" Grounded? For what?!"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Tom"|-0.524006575345993|" Let's jog your memory, Marinette. Monday morning, absent from P.E..."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Marinette"|-0.288325190544128|" I was in study hall."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Tom"|-0.74177548289299|" Friday evening, absent from study hall."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Marinette"|-0.535719126462936|" I was at P.E.!"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Tom"|-0.622672110795975|" You're never where you're supposed to be, Marinette! The only way we can keep track of you is by keeping you here, grounded."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Marinette"|-0.246739387512207|" But I was invited... Nino is my friend, he was counting on me."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Alec"|0.581096529960632|" So, the challenge the viewers have chosen for you is... To get the mayor of Paris, André Bourgeois, to dance! Thank you for agreeing to play with us today, sir. What are Nino's chances tonight?"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"André"|-0.698494762182236|"Zero. I despise dancing. The last time I set foot on a dance floor, Madonna was in kindergarten."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Tom"|-0.461789548397064|" I know Nino's your friend. But until your unexcused absences come to an end, that's the way it's going to be."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Marinette"|0.759617209434509|" Awesome. "|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Tikki"|-0.785416230559349|" Can you blame them? How are they supposed to know that you're missing class to save the world?"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Marinette"|-0.430063605308533|"I guess being grounded comes with the territory of being a top secret superhero. Doesn't seem fair though."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Tikki"|-0.19126832485199|" It's not. But hey, if Nino wins, you're not grounded next week. You can go see him at the show!"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Marinette"|-0.278792262077332|" Yeah, but Adrien was there today! "|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Hawk Moth"|-0.609440743923187|"The Challenge... what an interesting concept. A TV show with such potential with negative emotions. Oh, the destructive mayhem we could cause..."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Marinette"|-0.266410231590271|" Seriously? How can you say that, Alya?"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Alya"|-0.778538018465042|" Sorry, but I kinda get your dad, Marinette. You're never where you say you'll be. Showing up late, splitting mysteriously and all. I'd almost suspect you were leading...a double life."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Marinette"|-0.766083672642708|"Gimme a break! You're being ridiculous."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Adrien"|-0.476778209209442|"No! It's okay!"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Alec"|-0.0235167741775513|" Victory! Challenge conquered by Nino. You moved your head to the beat, Mayor Bourgeois! That counts as dancing!"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"André Bourgeois"|-0.705104053020477|"What?! That's not true! My neck was... itching, that's all."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Alec"|0.187607884407043|" Relieving an itch to the beat counts as dancing, too! Nino, congratulations. You'll return in one week to meet your next challenge! And now, for our next contestant, welcome Simon Grimault!"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Adrien"|0.646104216575623|"Awesome, dude!"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Alec"|-0.155144095420837|" Mr. Grimault, you are a hypnotist. You use cards to hypnotize people to get what you want from them!"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Simon"|-0.540138900279999|" Well, yes, I'm a hypnotist. But, uh, I don't use my skills to get anything."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Alec"|0.59640109539032|" So, your challenge today, Simon, is to use your talents to bring a very elusive celebrity to this very TV set! Give it up for the king of fashion, Gabriel Agreste!"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Gabriel"|0.460779786109924|" What is this show? I was told this was an interview."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Nino"|-0.511425912380219|" Dude, your dad!"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Alec"|0.660480618476868|" Do your thing, Grimault, let's see if you can bring Mr. Agreste here with your hypnotic persuasion!"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Simon"|-0.645886659622192|" I told you, I don't make people"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Alec"|-0.402169704437256|" Ha! A shy hypnotist! How funny is that, Gabriel?"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Gabriel"|-0.768434971570969|" Hilarious. Your show is pathetic. And so is your contestant. Control me? Never. "|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Alec"|-0.515446186065674|" Huh?"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Adrien"|0.529189825057983|" That's my dad, all right."|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Alec"|-0.504745900630951|" Looks like Mr. Agreste has turned on your challenge. Game over!"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Simon"|-0.712428629398346|" But... that's not fair! I didn't even get time to... "|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Hawk Moth"|-0.493313491344452|" Yes. Humiliation and anger. The perfect elements for transforming a loser into a winner.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize him!"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Hawk Moth"|0.622603416442871|" I am Hawk Moth. You are now Simon Says. I will help you be the most powerful hypnotist ever. You will help me in return when the time's right. So, do we have a deal, Simon Says?"|1|23|"Simon Says"
"Simon"|0.48561692237854|" Simon says yes. "|1|23|"Simon Says"

"Butler Jean"|-0.337409973144531|" Pardon me madame, but your daughter Mademoiselle Zoé has arrived."|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Audrey"|-0.73381307721138|" Zoé?Oh, you look terrible! I'm guessing the flight was horrific."|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Zoé"|-0.735047698020935|" Someone in economy class- uh- smelled like disgusting cologne, and the flight attendants refused to open a window to air help the plane!"|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Audrey"|-0.730195015668869|" Your father forgot to provide a private jet for you too busy for anyone, as usual. It's fine that you want to come live with us in Paris, but what exactly was wrong with your boarding school again?"|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Zoé"|-0.261053800582886|" I- I found roaches in my locker, can you believe it?"|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Audrey"|0.303848266601562|" Well, that's nice, dear. Jean Quinton. Take her to see her sister."|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Chloé"|0.173287391662598|" So… you're Zoé? Blonde hair, blue eyes… Good, so far you're measuring up to the family standards, you can make an acceptable sister physically, at least. Cellphone!You'll have to change the case. Not enough gold or diamonds!Ah! What are those?!See these? These shoes are light and in life, there are winners and losers. Winners have their perfect little feet in these shoes while losers get crushedunder the soles. So you want them?Uh uh uh! If you want to be a winner and be part of this family, you're gonna have to earn your place. But don't worry, I'll be your mentor and if you prove worthy enough to be my sister, well then, maybe…I'll let you borrow my shoes! Rule number one: your father only exists to give you everything you want whenever you want.DADDY!I want the limo painted pink before I go to school!"|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"André"|-0.306356489658356|" What? But sweetheart-"|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Chloé"|0.269322156906128|"Since your father isn't here, you'll use mine! If you become my sister, of course. Rule number two: you need a minion. Where's yours?"|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Zoé"|-0.646193653345108|" Uhhh, I left them…in New York!"|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Chloé"|-0.748454660177231|"Fatal mistake! You never go anywhere without your minion!Don't confuse a minion for a patsy which I'll teach you about later. A minion is someone who does everything for you.Aren't you done with that math homework yet?"|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Sabrina"|-0.667399287223816|" Sorry, Chloé. It's taking me a little longer 'cause it's so dark in here but now that my eyes are used to having no light, it'll go much faster! "|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Chloé"|-0.140404880046844|" Now, a patsy is there to suffer for your own entertainment. If you're good enough, a patsy can last you a lifetime. I have an old one but it hasn't been working so well ever since I became a superhero. I got too soft. She's yours if you could do something with her. "|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Chloé"|0.585208058357239|" Another super important rule. Number 72: All the Boys have to be crazy about you carrying your school bag up the stairs should be the highlight of their day. Not you, no, not you, either or you, but you can shine my shoes in your dreams tonight! You!Here! "|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Sabrina"|-0.76048643887043|"Sorry! "|4|84|"Sole Crusher"

"Chloé"|0.707169890403748|"We’ll buy you a new name later.This is Zoé. She’s only my half-sister for now but you must still treat her with respect, so bow down...uh, I mean give her the welcome her status deserves."|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Rose"|0.121218800544739|" Her sister? Chloé has a sister?"|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Alya"|-0.680157899856567|" If we’re lucky, she’ll only be half as horrible."|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Marinette"|-0.62325331568718|" Relax girls! I met her at the bakery earlier. She’s totally nothing like Chloé. She’s actually really nice! And besides we shouldn’t make snap judgments about people before we get to know them, right? "|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Adrien"|0.599505305290222|"Hey, what's up, man."|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Chloé"|-0.211349427700043|" Ah, rule number 148: obviously, you need a guy BFF to wrap around your finger. Preferably gorgeous and very rich.That one over there is mine, Adrikins! He's the best there is. So keep your hands off, you here! We'll find you a less handsome one because you're less pretty than me, obviously.Ah! Here comes the patsy I was telling you about. If you can do a number on her, then I'll make you my real sister. Watch and learn.Still loafing around, Dupain-Cheng?Hello, she's a baker's daughter, get it? "|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Marinette"|0.75381600856781|" Hey, Zoé. What'd you think about the macaroons? Good, huh?"|4|84|"Sole Crusher"

"Zoé"|-0.716726779937744|"Y-yeah, we've met.This clueless klutz knocked me down! So she gave me some super, uh… disgusting… macaroonsthinking that it would be enough to make up for it, but since I have good taste, I threw them out. "|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Sabrina"|0.570864319801331|"Can I do your homework?"|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Mr. Damocles"|-0.148544907569885|" Find a spot. Find a spot! Mid-year admission is not so easy. There's a lot of paperwork-"|4|84|"Sole Crusher"

"Zoé"|-0.201233625411987|"Would you like me to call my stepfather, Mayor Bourgeois, and let him know how utterly useless you've been. So useless, in fact, that this would surely run just as wellwithout you!"|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Mr. Damocles"|-0.759285405278206|"Uhhhh…"|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Mr. Damocles"|0.702576160430908|" May I introduce your new schoolmate, Zoé. Please obey, I mean, give her a warm welcome."|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Marinette"|0.506331205368042|"I don't understand. When I met her this morning, she was so nice."|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Alya"|-0.598235160112381|" That's crazy. Chloé's influence is so toxic that she's managed to corrupt her sister in a few hours."|4|84|"Sole Crusher"
"Alix"|-0.0516622066497803|" We gotta get her out of there."|4|84|"Sole Crusher"

"Chloé"|-0.0532746315002441|" Needs improvement, but not such a bad start. As a reward, I'll let you touch my diamond shoes when we're home. "|4|84|"Sole Crusher"

"Zoé"|-0.606067597866058|" I'm... really sorry about today. I thought that if I did everything Chloé wanted me to, she'd accept me. I just wanted to meet my family's expectations. Which is why I left New York in the first place. At the boarding school, I was playing a part; being someone else, hoping they'd accept me. But finally, I just couldn't anymore. That's when everyone turned against me, and one day, I found roaches in my locker. They all said I was a loser. Maybe they were right. I get that I'm different, and... I'd understand if you guys didn't want me as a friend."|4|84|"Sole Crusher"

"Ladybug"|-0.693723261356354|" That would be pointless. She could make the train take off again just as quickly. We must capture the Akuma first!"|3|66|"Startrain"

"Nino"|-0.271530568599701|" You sure?Thanks, Marinette!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Sabrina"|-0.772826820611954|"That's terrible! You hear that, Chloé? Aurore's GPA dropped a whole point on her last report card!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Chloé"|-0.750426337122917|" Well, you can't be Little Miss Weather girl and Little Miss Good Grades at the same time! We better not make her cry, Sabrina,or she might turn into Stormy Weather and start raining on us. . What a ridiculous power!Utterly ridiculous! "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Marinette"|-0.620255291461945|" Aurore won't be transforming, because her grade average will be up again next term.Don't hesitate to ask if you need any help. "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Aurore"|0.396968126296997|" Thanks, Marinette! "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Chloé"|-0.525670826435089|" Yeah, right. Once a villain, always a villain! "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Marinette"|-0.388646245002747|"Unlike you, Chloé; people do change for the better!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Chloé"|-0.671227306127548|" Well, you will never change, Marinette Dupain-Cheng. You'll always be Adri-dumb...I mean, Adri-bummed abababababa lame!And you, Alya Césaire. You still haven't found out who Ladybug is, right?. Well, you two are made for each other! You're both just as clueless as the other. Back to you, now- "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Chloé"|-0.705701112747192|" Huh! She's gone now because of you two. And I wasn't even halfway done trashing her.Come on, Sabrina! "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Marinette"|-0.71963307261467|" Chloé might not be completely wrong, you know, Tikki! I haven't changed. Look at how I always fail when I try to have a basic conversation with Adrien.As soon as I'm in front of him, my heart starts beating like crazy and my words come tumbling out, making no sense whatsoever. It seems like I'm paralyzed."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Marinette"|-0.160456478595734|" Um, he Hey! "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|0.313398241996765|"Hey."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"

"Marinette"|0.631017208099365|" ...are beneath that strong disguise. Every day we see each other and I hope that you'll be mine, together our love could be so true, please-"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Marinette"|0.152950048446655|"please, will you be my valentine?It's so beautiful. But I'll never know what he thinks of me, or who this poem he wrote was meant for. Uh, I'mso- so lame!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Tikki"|-0.303976774215698|" You are not, Marinette! You've changed a lot since the beginning of the year and since you first met Adrien!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Marinette"|-0.307526588439941|" You're right! I have changed. I got more and more clumsy since I met him!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Tikki"|-0.586760878562927|" No!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Tikki"|0.493856906890869|" Think of all the things you've done since the first day back at school! You went to the movies with Adrien!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Marinette"|-0.617731422185898|" Yeah, how could I forget that? In my PJ's wearing a towel! "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Tikki"|-0.42714649438858|" True... maybe that wasn't the best example. What about the time you practiced for the video game competition? Right here in your bedroom!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Marinette"|-0.607350647449493|" Oh! Hahaha. Sorry."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|-0.591038674116135|" No, you go."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Both"|0.280181288719177|" I'll use the other one.Ah! "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Tikki"|0.464037895202637|"And when you fenced with him!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Armand"|-0.608233571052551|" Attaque! Touche. Point!Continue!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Marinette"|0.681905150413513|"Thanks!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|0.257025122642517|"All I did was lunge. You've got good reflexes!En garde!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Tikki"|0.653631210327148|" Adrien has become a true friend!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Marinette"|-0.249290764331818|" "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Marinette"|0.344954013824463|"You're right!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|-0.734171628952026|"You never got a chance to open it with all that was going on."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|0.757001042366028|" I always carry the lucky charm you gave me with me wherever I go, and I think it works pretty well. So... I figured it was my turn to make one for you."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Marinette"|0.75400722026825|" You're so wonderful... Oh, uh- it's wonderful, what a charm! Uh... luck charm! I-I'll wear the charm um, with luck! Basically, um... thank you."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Marinette"|0.707863569259644|"Adrien's become a friend who I can talk to about anything. Except when it comes to my feelings for him."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Tikki"|0.447100758552551|" It's better than nothing, though, isn't it?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Marinette"|0.464915156364441|" Can you still be in love with someone even after they become your friend?Do you think I'llever be able to tell him that he means much more to me than just a friend?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Gabriel"|-0.0199207663536072|" To the attention of Mrs. Tsurugi. Things may not be going exactly the way we planned but change can be a good thing. I'm confident it’ll only strengthen our agreement in the end."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nathalie"|-0.412246942520142|" It's true. Things aren't going as planned. For me, either."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nathalie"|-0.486709773540497|" There's no point in waiting for your father, Adrien. I should never have taken this job. It’s too much sometimes. Don't forget to practice your piano before you go to bed."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nathalie"|0.723385334014893|" As I watched Adrien growing up, my affection for him has grown, too."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nathalie"|0.41698956489563|" I'm… sure he'll understand, sir."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|-0.748919874429703|" My dad's flaking, isn't he? Let me guess! Something came up?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nathalie"|-0.271181344985962|" Yes, but he’s reserved the best seats in the house for you, Adrien. Front row."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|0.689454197883606|" As usual. The best money can buy."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nathalie"|0.488792538642883|" The fencing hall is booked for 6:05 p.m. and the Chinese classroom for 6:35 p.m. just as you wished. And remember that you have to make an appearance at the Agreste Foundation’s Heroes Gala tonight."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|0.646050095558167|" I’ll be there, for sure. "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nathalie"|-0.391668856143951|" As I've watched Emilie falling deeper into an endless sleep, my sadness for her has deepened, too. And little by little…"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nathalie"|0.678111553192139|" …my admiration for Gabriel, a man who do anything for his family, has turned into something more. I never thought I would have feelings like this. I would do anything for Gabriel Agreste, no matter the cost."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Hawk Moth"|0.613942503929138|" Are you ready, Nathalie?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nathalie"|-0.357884526252747|"They've been keeping you from achieving your dream for way too long. I will go to any lengths to end the reign of Ladybug and Cat Noir."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Hawk Moth"|0.569373607635498|" Good."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Gabriel"|0.114521741867065|" Nathalie, are you alright?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nathalie"|0.517960786819458|"Yes. Thank you, sir."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Gabriel"|-0.444616854190826|" I feel a strong negative emotion. We’ll finish this later. "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|-0.0311154723167419|"I have to tell you how amazing this photoshoot was, Dad.I'm sorry, Father. It was very interesting."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Gabriel"|-0.0322971343994141|" You’ll tell me all about it later, Adrien. I'm busy at the moment."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|0.511186003684998|" In that case, can I go out and meet up with my friends?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Gabriel"|0.300096035003662|" You'll see them at school tomorrow. "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Gabriel"|-0.629069298505783|" This negative emotion I'm feeling… it's familiar."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nooroo"|-0.467297255992889|" Maybe it's your son’s emotion. You should spend more time with him."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Gabriel"|0.730877757072449|" I'm doing all of this so that he can be happy again."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nooroo"|-0.477129876613617|" But aren't you in danger of losing him if you continue down this path?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nathalie"|-0.474294781684875|" Your father is very busy."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nooroo"|-0.320551097393036|" Your Miraculous was not intended to be used in this way, Master."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Gabriel"|-0.522429287433624|" I forbid you to talk to me like that, Nooroo. "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Gabriel"|-0.0202228426933289|" Nooroo, dark wings rise!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Hawk Moth"|-0.357559442520142|" What if Nooroo is right? Am I taking too many risks?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Ladybug"|-0.0209701061248779|" You have to trust me!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|-0.730008780956268|" Always!Yeah-ha!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Hawk Moth"|-0.586760878562927|"No!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Hawk Moth"|-0.345000863075256|" I no longer have a choice. I must succeed, at any price.Fly away, my little akuma, and evilize her!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Hawk Moth"|0.509027242660522|"Stormy Weather. People have told you that you'll never change? Well, they're right. People don't change, they grow! This time, your powers will be even stronger as you know them well. Show them how you're able to control all the forces of nature."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Aurore"|0.0849698781967163|" Alright, Hawk Moth. "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|-0.62260827422142|"My father will never change."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Plagg"|0.57194721698761|" I like people who never change. That way you always know what to expect."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Plagg"|-0.0101129412651062|" Look at me."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Plagg"|0.595076203346252|" I love eating cheese."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Plagg"|-0.623093664646149|" Why would I change that?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Plagg"|-0.52940046787262|" I wouldn't be myself..."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Plagg"|-0.214997708797455|" ...anymore if I did."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|0.35874879360199|" Does this mean my life will never change?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Plagg"|-0.590947479009628|" 'Course not, don't worry. Think of everything that's happened since the end of last summer."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Plagg"|0.31497049331665|" You're finally going to school. And you know I still find it weird for a Boy your age to love going to school so much when you could just stay at home."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|-0.57338085770607|" I was tired of being cooped up at home, never seeing anyone, all because of my father. I met a lot of friends at school."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Plagg"|-0.133727014064789|" See? You've already started to change."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|-0.62407448887825|" But father still hasn't."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Plagg"|-0.216737031936646|" You sure about that?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Plagg"|-0.720281034708023|" He didn't punish you after you went to the movies with that girl all by yourself."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|0.247371792793274|" True. We even watched mother's movie together instead."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Plagg"|-0.192732453346252|" And you played a duet on the piano with him, didn't you?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|0.71945858001709|" And he allowed me to meet my friends afterwards."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Rose"|0.684928894042969|" : I love unicorns, and cute little fluffy cats."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|0.798286318778992|" And for once, his birthday gift to me was amazing."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|0.115031003952026|"Hey, dude!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Alya"|0.518113851547241|" Yo! Nice scarf, Adrien. Off the chain."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|0.63695502281189|" Yeah, can you believe my dad got this for me?It's so awesome. He's given me the same lame pen for three years in a row."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nino"|-0.0311771631240845|" Wow, I guess anyone can change. Adults can be cool when you least expect it."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Plagg"|-0.47578763961792|" Your father's like one of those wheels of cheese with a very thick rind. Once you manage to sink your teeth into it, you realize it's all soft inside. Or slightly rotten."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|-0.669452846050262|" Plagg, you're really gross. But you're right. Thank you. "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Plagg"|-0.773767158389091|" It's not me! I swear I didn't use my Cataclysm!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|-0.107019484043121|"What is that?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Adrien"|-0.651455760002136|" Plagg, claws out!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Stormy Weather"|0.37040102481842|" I'm going to use this volcano to move the Earth away from the sun. Soon the world will plunge into a perpetual winter, and Earthlings will be nothing but frozen food. Then you'll realize just how powerful I really am. "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Cat Noir"|0.464310884475708|" Can she really do that?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Ladybug"|-0.606494635343552|" Probably. But don't worry, kitty. We're not gonna let her rain on Paris' parade."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Cat Noir"|-0.359230399131775|" Hey! Was that a pun I heard, m'lady?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Ladybug"|0.549141407012939|" Yep. A little change is good, don't you think? "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Cat Noir"|0.666343688964844|" I love that girl! "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nadja"|-0.499380528926849|" Don't be bemused, it's just the news. Astronauts that orbit around the earth have confirmed that our planet has shifted on its axis, and it’s moving away from the sun!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nino"|0.407588481903076|" Stormy Weather seems way stronger than the first time around."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Alya"|-0.710690647363663|" And it's that brat Chloé's fault again! "|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nino"|-0.454343616962433|" If only things go back to the way they were before, before Hawk Moth and all those villains."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Alya"|0.0128437280654907|" You mean before we met?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nino"|-0.427501261234283|" No, of course not. I didn't mean it that way!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Alya"|-0.348940551280975|" It's weird to think of it, but if it wasn't for Hawk Moth, you and I might not be here right now."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nino"|-0.438722729682922|" Actually..."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nino"|0.350621223449707|" ...it's thanks to Ladybug we're together."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Ladybug"|0.0310343503952026|" Stay put and you'll be safe."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Alya"|0.701466202735901|" True, and for becoming superheroes too."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Alya"|-0.0850443243980408|" Both of us."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Ladybug"|0.584314823150635|"Rena Rouge and Carapace, I need you both!"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Nino"|0.286983251571655|"You're Rena Rouge?"|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"
"Alya"|0.445478081703186|" Of course I am."|3|60|"Stormy Weather 2"

"Tikki"|0.591179132461548|" Master Fu is the last known member of the Order of the Guardians!"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Wayzz"|0.713796019554138|"Guardians of the Miraculous! I'm Wayzz, Master Fu's kwami. It's a pleasure to meet you, Marinette."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.0180242657661438|" Uhh, you too! "|2|28|"The Collector"
"Master Fu"|0.488948702812195|" We guardians are responsible for protecting and distributing the Miraculous, for the good of all humanity. We are chosen in childhood and trained for many years, specially for this mission. When we were much, much younger, we...I made a mistake. The guardians' temple was destroyed, all because of me! Two of the Miraculous were lost that day. The Butterfly and the Peacock. Also gone forever was the ancient spellbook!"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.59270653128624|" But all it has are drawings of old superheroes and a bunch of strange symbols."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Master Fu"|0.149345397949219|" Not strange to a Guardian. Back in the days, I was never given the opportunity to even have a look at it, but I've been taught enough to be able to partially decipher the code."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Master Fu"|0.693612813949585|" These pages contain various spells capable of giving Ladybug and Cat Noir special abilities we haven't known about, until now! Obviously, this book is invaluable."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Gabriel"|0.0258258581161499|" Why did you take the book?"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Adrien"|-0.643514096736908|" I... I just wanted to know what you were hiding behind that portrait that was so important. You.. you never told me about those things. I was intending to give it back to you, I swear! But then... I lost it."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Gabriel"|-0.086259663105011|" How can I possibly trust you again, Adrien?"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Adrien"|-0.602801591157913|" Sorry... I'll get you another copy."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Gabriel"|0.822812914848328|" It's one of a kind! The book's the source of my inspiration."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Adrien"|-0.575431555509567|" I didn't know that. I hardly know anything about you, Father."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Gabriel"|-0.561820596456528|" You won't be returning to school. You'll be home-schooled again...with Nathalie."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Master Fu"|0.508902549743652|" I've always believed that whoever possessed this spellbook must also have the Peacock and the Butterfly Miraculous."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.416402757167816|" Wait a sec, you mean whoever owned the spellbook could be Hawk Moth?"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Master Fu"|0.699701070785522|" How did you discover this book, Marinette?"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.400110721588135|"I... uh... I found it, lying on a bench in a park close to... close to the school."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Master Fu"|-0.402416110038757|" You didn't see who it belonged to, then?"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.561079472303391|" No. No, I...didn't."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Master Fu"|-0.690922975540161|" What a shame. For a moment, I thought we were about to discover the identity of Hawk Moth. We would've had a chance to defeat him."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|0.389026761054993|" Uh... I could investigate if you want."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Master Fu"|-0.44761049747467|" But you must be very careful, Marinette. If you succeed, you may well find yourself face to face with Hawk Moth."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.271470248699188|" I'll be very careful, I promise."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Tikki"|-0.600376486778259|"Why did you lie to Master Fu?!"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|0.146817564964294|" I couldn't tell him that Adrien was the one who had the book. Adrien can't be Hawk Moth!But what if he is?Th-That would mean that I'm crazy in love with a supervillain! I can't be crazy in love with a supervillain... I... I'd have to fight him and..."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Tikki"|-0.697511851787567|" Calm down Marinette, I'm sure there's an explanation."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.0793368220329285|" I need to get to the bottom of this."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Tikki"|0.52262282371521|" Do you know where to find Adrien?"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|0.412646174430847|" I know that Boy's schedule by heart."|2|28|"The Collector"

"Marinette"|-0.640966355800629|" I don't see him. Something's up. Adrien never misses his fencing lessons."|2|28|"The Collector"

"Chloé"|-0.748412907123566|" This is a terrible tragedy! "|2|28|"The Collector"

"Marinette"|-0.51386970281601|" What? Why?"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Nino"|-0.491437554359436|" Something about losing this major important book that belongs to his dad."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.544566094875336|" His dad? Ha! Phew!"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Chloé"|-0.709607809782028|"\Phew\?!"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.739739209413528|"\Phew\. Cause I... I was scared it was super serious. I mean, yeah, sure, it really is serious but it's not like he's sick or anything, you know. Surely we can fix this, right? We won't just stand by and let this happen! Ha! "|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.702523350715637|" So it wasn't Adrien's book. It was his father's! Adrien isn't Hawk Moth!I knew it! Adrien doesn't have an evil bone in his body."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Tikki"|-0.527306616306305|" Except, according to Nino, Adrien did take the book without his father's permission."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|0.667644858360291|" Well, he must've had a good reason to do it."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Tikki"|0.0107684135437012|" You realize, based on Master Fu's theory, Adrien's father could be Hawk Moth."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.39135879278183|" No way! It couldn't be! Hmm... An eccentric artist who never leaves his home. Mysterious, very intelligent, but cold, even with his own son. This is a very strong lead, Tikki!"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Tikki"|-0.343996107578278|" Please be careful, Marinette!"|2|28|"The Collector"

"Adrien"|-0.130257308483124|" I've gotta find that book, or I'll never be allowed to return to school."|2|28|"The Collector"

"Cat Noir"|-0.748981803655624|" You were akumatized by Hawk Moth. But don't worry, it's over now!"|2|28|"The Collector"

"Gabriel"|0.587366938591003|" See you very soon!"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.0489512085914612|" So, since Gabriel Agreste was akumatized, he can't possibly be Hawk Moth, right? "|2|28|"The Collector"
"Master Fu"|0.43312668800354|" That's very probable, but...how did you find out that Gabriel Agreste was the owner of the Spellbook?"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.251871705055237|" At first, I was thinking the book belonged to Gabriel Agreste's son, Adrien, 'cause I saw him with it at school — well before it was stolen by a girl and before Tikki got it back; and I'd only just met you so I...I didn't know if I could tell you that, so yeah."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Master Fu"|-0.563769578933716|" You were afraid in case the one you love turned out to be Hawk Moth."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.220709264278412|"Wha... Uh, no, uh, how did you know that? I mean, I don't love him at all.Oh, all right, yes, Adrien is amazing. I couldn't stand the thought of him being a supervillain. "|2|28|"The Collector"
"Master Fu"|0.346197009086609|" You know, Marinette, if we want to be stronger than Hawk Moth, we have to trust each other."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.644103586673737|" I know; but now, Adrien will never be able to come back to school because I can never give him that book back. I'll never ever see him again! "|2|28|"The Collector"
"Master Fu"|-0.484751403331757|" There isn't a single problem that can't be solved, Marinette.These modern inventions really are quite incredible. Hmm."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.661101311445236|" So, when Adrien put the book down and walked away, I wanted to take a peek. You see, I thought it was a portfolio with lots of pictures of him 'cause he's so cute. Uh, but you already knew that.Anyway, um, when he came back, I was scared he'd see me staring at his book so I hid it in my backpack and I know it was a dumb thing to do. I'm really, really sorry."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Gabriel"|0.513293027877808|" I see. So, you're one of his admirers?"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|-0.149665832519531|" Admirers? Yeah. That's the word.You won't say anything to him, will you?Are you going to let Adrien come back to school?"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Gabriel"|-0.6985964179039|" Well, considering he didn't actually lose my book as it was borrowed by you, yes I will."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|0.556468963623047|"Thank you.Hmm, can I ask you a question?I flipped through the book and it looked really awesome. Those illustrations of legendary heroes are super...inspiring. Where did you get it?"|2|28|"The Collector"
"Gabriel"|0.58167040348053|" I found it while I was on a trip overseas with my wife. I've never seen another copy of it."|2|28|"The Collector"
"Marinette"|0.33482301235199|" Well then, you're very lucky to own it. "|2|28|"The Collector"

"Sabrina"|0.0759552717208862|" It's okay, Marinette. You and I will do all the research, and the writing for our project, and then, Chloé can present it! That way it's equal."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Marinette"|-0.637259989976883|" That's not equal at all! Is that how you two work?!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"

"Marinette"|-0.5172438621521|" Sabrina, Chloé's totally taking advantage of you. You don't have to do what she says. That's not how a real best friend acts!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Chloé"|-0.725268095731735|" Ugh, not only am I Sabrina's best friend, I'm her only friend, so she better do what I say, 'cause without me, she has nothing."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Marinette"|-0.619605422019958|" Well, I'd rather have no friends than be friends with you."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Chloé"|-0.490424036979675|" Whatever. I've got more important things to worry about. My hair is a hot mess and Jean Claude promised to work his magic. Later!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"

"Marinette"|-0.628031462430954|" Sounds...great?"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"

"Chloé"|-0.717307329177856|" Ugh! What do you mean, you're not doing my assignment?!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Sabrina"|-0.43067854642868|" Marinette's right! I...I'm not your slave!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Marinette"|-0.610363394021988|" I never actually said that..."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Chloé"|-0.298090934753418|" But Marinette didn't buy a super cute beret at Gabriel's, and I did! And perhaps I could lend it to you."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Marinette"|-0.50154635310173|" Excuse me, but are you trying to bribe her into staying your friend? With a hat?"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Sabrina"|0.6006920337677|" Uhhh... really, really adorable hat! That would look fantastic on me!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Chloé"|-0.165350317955017|" No, excuse from ME, but you are trying to steal my friend from me, with homework!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Chloé"|-0.440483033657074|" Ahh! My hair!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Chloé"|0.137860417366028|" Ahhh! Please! Please! Ahhhh!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"

"Marinette"|0.164726614952087|" Time to transform!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Marinette"|-0.499254763126373|" Tikki, spots on! Ah!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Chloé"|-0.590879410505295|" No! Stop!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Ladybug"|-0.484963357448578|" Run and hide! "|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Cat Noir"|-0.615744829177856|" I got wind that you were being blown away by a hairy situation."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Ladybug"|-0.65563553571701|" Fewer puns, more action!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Cat Noir"|-0.584426999092102|"Well, that guy looks pretty sketchy!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Ladybug"|-0.564496457576752|" Where'd he go?"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Cat Noir"|-0.23916107416153|" I don't know, but he sure has a way of illustrating his point."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Ladybug"|-0.779275208711624|"Ughhh..."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Cat Noir"|-0.467471241950989|" Seems this Evillustrator's targeting you specifically, Chloé. Any idea why?"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Chloé"|-0.625467628240585|" No. Everyone adores me."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Ladybug"|0.625516295433044|"Yeah, because you're sooo adorable."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Chloé"|0.713947296142578|" Yeesss! Ladybug just said I'm adorable! I totally need a picture of the two of us together! "|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Ladybug"|-0.697121262550354|" Ugh! That was unpleasant."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Chloé"|-0.240550994873047|" Well, I look great, of course, but your smile is all wonky. I'll take another! "|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Ladybug"|-0.667567521333694|" Sorry, I'm just a little camera shy."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"

"Ladybug"|0.728896975517273|" Yeah, great."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Cat Noir"|0.482699036598206|" So what's the deal? Why are you acting so weird? Come on, you gotta admit that having this girl worship you is pretty awesome."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Ladybug"|-0.322075605392456|"Ugh, seriously? I'm over this! Let's go!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Cat Noir"|-0.599542319774628|" Are you kidding me? And what if the Evillustrator attacks her again?"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Ladybug"|0.397986531257629|" Fine! You stay! Later!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Cat Noir"|0.573841452598572|" What do you mean later?"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Ladybug"|-0.441290676593781|" I mean, you're the one who wants to protect her, but you don't need me. So, later! "|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Chloé"|-0.0991827845573425|"Ahhh! Ladybug! Text me! OK!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"

"Marinette"|-0.737567096948624|" Sorry, Tikki... Chloé! She just...fires up this little red bug!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Tikki"|-0.736728996038437|" Well, simmer down! A hot head isn't going to get you anywhere!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Marinette"|-0.0742657780647278|" It's hard to keep my cool. Especially in school. Oh my gosh! Sabrina! The project! "|1|7|"The Evillustrator"

"Marinette"|-0.720400243997574|" Okay... But why did you attack Chloé?"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Evillustrator"|-0.727835595607758|" 'Cause Chloé is cruel and selfish!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Marinette"|-0.554375559091568|" Can't argue with that... Are you going to hurt me?"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Evillustrator"|0.421522259712219|" You? You're Marinette! You're beautiful and sweet and... you're perfect and I could never hurt you!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"

"Tikki"|0.10597562789917|" What are you thinking, Marinette?"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Marinette"|-0.562625885009766|" I'm thinking poor Nathaniel's got a crush on me. And his alter ego, the Evillustrator's gonna get crushed by Ladybug!"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Tikki"|-0.123069524765015|" Yes, but... how exactly is Ladybug going to crush this crush when...you're going on a date with as Marinette?"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Marinette"|-0.300533950328827|" Oh, maybe some cool cat needs to crash the party."|1|7|"The Evillustrator"
"Chloé"|-0.16849422454834|" Ohhh... Sabrina is so selfish! Making me do this project by myself?! Ugh, my brain hurts... Huh? Hey! Cat Noir, Are you any good at particle physics?"|1|7|"The Evillustrator"

"Marinette"|-0.508648753166199|"I'm sorry, that wasn't cool. But you can leave Chloé. I need you to protect this girl instead. Her name is Marinette. Really cute, isn't she?

"Tikki"|-0.0487879514694214|" What's done is done; we can't change what happened. We can only move forward. Alya must not find out who you are. You know how persistent she can be with her blog totally dedicated to Ladybug. "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Marinette"|-0.691342532634735|" But how? Maybe I'm not cut out for this whole Ladybug thing. "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Tikki"|0.475204348564148|" You are the chosen one, Marinette. It will all work out, trust me. Everyone has a past they can learn from.This will show you why. "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Marinette"|0.208819508552551|" An exhibition at the Louvre? On the pharaoh Tutankhamun? What does that have to do with my book and Alya? "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Tikki"|0.412568330764771|" You must persuade Alya to go there with you, and make sure she brings the book. You'll tell her you found out something about Ladybug. "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Marinette"|0.024144172668457|" At the museum? "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Tikki"|-0.225159466266632|" You'll see! "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Marinette"|-0.106201827526093|" Well, I don't know how I'm gonna convince Alya to go to an Egyptian exhibit, much less convince her that I'm not Ladybug! "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Tikki"|0.558217883110046|" She will be interested, and so will you. Promise . "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Alya"|0.674732327461243|" Can you believe it? All I gotta do is find to do who this history book belongs to and BAM, I figure out Ladybug's true identity! I'm so on this one! "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Marinette"|-0.0198296308517456|" You really think you could figure out who Ladybug is from a textbook that every high school student owns? "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Alya"|-0.477211058139801|" Yep. 'Cause our school is the only school that uses that book! HA! So, all I gotta do is find out which girl in tenth grade lost her history book last week. There are forty-three girls, not counting myself "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Marinette"|-0.71352145075798|" Forty-two! Not count you... or me. "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Alya"|-0.673444330692291|"Hmm, yesterday somebody didn't have their textbook in class. "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Marinette"|-0.616888642311096|"Uh I left it at home. You know how I always forget my stuff. "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Alya"|-0.627207934856415|" Hmm...Just messing with you, Marinette. Of course I'll only drop you from my investigation when you bring your history book back to class. "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Jalil"|-0.674598515033722|" It's not broken! "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Alya"|0.160630822181702|"Uh, I'm okay too, thanks for asking. "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Jalil"|0.34515380859375|" I'm sorry. Hey, you're in the same grade as Alix, right? I'm her older brother, Jalil Kubdel. So you're into Tutankhamun too?Dad! "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Alya"|0.109891057014465|" Weird. So again girl, why are we here? This exhibit's got something to do with Ladybug? For reals? "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Marinette"|-0.251311004161835|" Well, uh...Yeah, it's over there."|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Alya"|-0.0787605047225952|" Hang on, 'cause we're going for a ride. Freak out! What you got here is no ordinary book, it's a tenth grade history book. And I should know, 'cause I've got this very same book. Could our very own Ladybug be a high school student, in real life? "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Adrien"|0.445839047431946|" That's crazy! What are the odds that we have the same textbook? Maybe we even go to the same school! "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Plagg"|-0.402928650379181|" Don't you think you know her then?Why bother yourself with ladies when you could be enjoying this? "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Adrien"|0.617177248001099|" For one, ladies smell about a thousand times better than that cheese. And they're much better-looking. "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Plagg"|-0.721069544553757|" Suit yourself. Your loss. "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Adrien"|-0.770010694861412|" My only loss is my appetite."|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Alya"|0.407789349555969|" Come on, tell me what it is already! "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Marinette"|-0.590781569480896|" No, no, cause... it wouldn't be a surprise then...for you or me. "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Jalil"|-0.0601181387901306|" I'm telling you, father, it's right there in the hieroglyphics.Excuse me. There, as you know, the one with the scepter is Tutankhamun, the first. And there, opposite is Nefertiti, his princess. There are exactly one hundred mummies beside them. She died several years before him, and the sun god Ra took her as his goddess. "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Mr. Kubdel"|0.57087516784668|" Yes, I know all that. I'm the director of this exhibition, remember? "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Jalil"|0.508893847465515|" Then you also know that Tutankhamun wanted to bring his princess back to life, by offering the sun god a new wife. This seemed to illustrate the ritual he devised. Nobody has ever fully deciphered the hieroglyphics, but I have! It's a magic chant that needs to be recited in order to complete the ritual! I'm sure of it! "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Marinette"|0.166916012763977|" He kinda reminds me of someone else with crazy ideas... you! "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Alya"|0.239447832107544|" You might think my theories about Ladybug are crazy, but you watch, girl, I'll prove you wrong. "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Mr. Kubdel"|0.570874214172363|" Jalil, these types of frescoes are almost always the illustration for a legend. They called it a legend for a reason... "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Jalil"|0.445658802986145|" That's what everyone thinks. But I know it's real. I can prove it! "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Mr. Kubdel"|0.156360626220703|" Really? Exactly how are you going to prove it? "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Jalil"|0.452678084373474|" I just need to get my hands on Tutankhamun's scepter and recite the spell! "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Mr. Kubdel"|-0.702690094709396|" Are you serious? Don't even think of touching that scepter. I'd lose my job on the spot. It's a priceless historical object! Not a toy! "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Jalil"|0.217536807060242|" Come on, dad! We have to try out the spell! What if Tutankhamun had found out how to bring people back to life? "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"
"Mr. Kubdel"|0.411912441253662|" Listen, Jalil! That's enough! Get your head out of those papyrus scrolls and focus on the real world! This one! "|1|3|"The Pharaoh"

"Marinette"|0.568951368331909|" Hey, girl."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Alya"|0.467135071754456|" Marinette, you are coming with me and Nino to the Grévin Wax Museum. Adrien invited us!"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.656087934970856|" Ah! Wha! But! Nuh—!"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Alya"|-0.521679222583771|" There's no saying no. We're coming to get you now. You don't have a choice, girl!"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nino"|0.258520722389221|"Do you think Marinette could come too? That way you two guys could—"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Alya"|-0.69317352771759|" Shhh!"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nino"|0.609188795089722|" Uh, you could... stare at the statues together! Marinette loves the... she loves statues! Which is perfect since the wax museum is, uh, full of them! "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|0.616279721260071|" Can we make that... three? "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nathalie"|0.393288373947144|"Mhmm."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Manon"|-0.735549747943878|" But Marinette!What about my superhero costume?Hmph, everyone always forgets about me."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.675503820180893|" Sorry, guys. I'm looking after Manon this afternoon. Go ahead without me."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|-0.1021448969841|" Would four work? Actually, more like three and a half."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nathalie"|0.564885973930359|" I'll see what I can do."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Alya"|-0.713283121585846|"You leave Adrien alone, and then, I'll leave Marinette alone..."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Manon"|-0.675947904586792|" Hey! Why are you leaving Marinette all alone? Don't you like her?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.550376951694489|" Huh, what're you guys talking about?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nino"|-0.65358978509903|" Nothing! It's got nothing to do with us leaving you and Adrien alone...Uh...! To... look at the statues as, uh, just friends, of course. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|-0.509750634431839|" Don't worry, Manon. It's just that Alya and Nino are Boyfriend and girlfriend, and they probably wanna spend some time alone together. Without us. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Manon"|-0.600616544485092|" Really? But I thought you and Marinette were Boyfriend and girlfriend.She has lots of photos of you all over her bedroom."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|0.42071533203125|"That's because she loves fashion and I'm a fashion model."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Manon"|0.0776413679122925|" But then why are there so many hearts drawn on them?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.381784617900848|"Those aren't heart! Those are, uh, upside-down spades! I was just coming up with some new, uh, patterns, for my fabric designs.You told me you wouldn't tell Nino!"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Alya"|-0.632610589265823|" I haven't told him. Right, Nino? I didn't tell you anything. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nino"|-0.503647357225418|" She didn't tell me. And besides, I told her I won't tell."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.70970207452774|" So you didn't tell anyone what Alya didn't tell you. Or did you?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Manon"|-0.590776652097702|" What are you guys talking about?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette, Nino, & Alya"|-0.709727585315704|" Nothing."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|0.403895378112793|" Hi, Véronique."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Véronique"|-0.636066675186157|" Thanks for coming on such short notice, Adrien. I'm sorry, but a piece of your statue went missing yet again!Just goes to show how popular you are."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Manon"|-0.619255721569061|" Look Marinette, we get to go in, even though it's closed! It's like we're princesses.Hey! Did you hear me? "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Alya"|-0.63148757815361|"Be careful this time, right? Marinette's the only one that's gotta spill the beans to Adrien— not us! So no matter what Adrien asks you, just deny. Okay? "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Manon"|-0.599233001470566|"Ahaha, wheee!Mr. Jagged! Can you give me an 'autygraph,' please?Why isn't anyone paying attention to me today!?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Véronique"|-0.288348019123077|"That's because this isn't the real Jagged Stone. It's a wax statue of him. The Grévin Wax Museum is the kingdom of illusions!"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Manon"|-0.049376904964447|" Woah! But he looks for reals! "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Véronique"|0.403852939605713|"The museum opened in 1882. We have about 200 wax statues on exhibition at any one time. We bring new celebrities in on a regular basis, the most recent one being Adrien!"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|0.709436655044556|"So if I've got this right, you and Alya wanna spend some alone time together, yeah?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Flashback Alya"|-0.579970896244049|" So no matter what Adrien asks you, just deny."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nino"|-0.589036852121353|" Not at all! That's not why we came here at all."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|0.71563720703125|" Oh! Well, then it's real nice of you guys to come here just to keep me company. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nino"|-0.244897723197937|" That's not why we came here at all, either!"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|0.201332807540894|" Really? So why did you want to come here then? Did it have something to do with Marinette?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nino"|-0.615464895963669|" Uh, no! You've got it all wrong, dude.Not with Marinette, or with you, and even less with you and Marinette alone by yourselves! "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|-0.389465510845184|" I'm confused. Marinette wants to be alone with me?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nino"|-0.616914689540863|"Marinette alone with you? Uh, no way, dude! You couldn't be further from the truth. It's the exact opposite, actually. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|-0.725668430328369|" Marinette doesn't want to be with me? "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|0.410419464111328|" Ah! Manon, come here! "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|-0.750713840126991|" Does she hate me?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nino"|-0.253389775753021|" No, no! Dude, she likes you a lot! I mean, no! I mean, yes? I mean... barely! She barely likes you a lot, so there you have it. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|-0.719966560602188|" You sure? I'd be really bummed if I knew Marinette didn't like me. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Véronique"|0.164210915565491|" The museum opened in 1882. We have about 200 wax statues..."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.651722490787506|" Why did you tell Nino everything? You promised you wouldn't."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Alya"|-0.470860421657562|" I didn't, I swear! Besides, even if I had told him everything, he would still be clueless. Ugh! Who cares anyway? I've set everything up with Nino, who doesn't know a thing, so you can finally pour your heart out to Adrien, girl! "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.514235883951187|" Wait, what?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Alya"|-0.420810341835022|" We'll take off, leaving you two solo. Then you can spill your beans."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.612609833478928|" Ah! Ahh! "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nino"|-0.579077780246735|"Not with Marinette, or with you, and even less with you and Marinette alone by yourselves! "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.606242805719376|" No! Not like that! I'm so not ready. I'd have to practice first, and wash my hair, and I'm not even wearing my lucky socks. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Alya"|0.28982937335968|" It's up to you, girl. But I'm just telling you: today's the day."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|0.527700185775757|"Manon, come here! "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Manon"|0.740926861763|"Look, Marinette! My mommy's a famous person too. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|0.13461434841156|" Yeah. Yeah, right. Okay. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Véronique"|0.54965341091156|" Welcome to the workshop! This is where our sculptors create and repair all of our statues.And this is where we store our wax. It comes straight from our very own beehives up on the roof of the museum. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Théo"|0.366163730621338|" So I heard we have to do your hand again. Right, Véronique?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Véronique"|0.0354734659194946|"Mmhmm."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nino"|0.668912887573242|"The beard's really well done."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Théo"|0.212577223777771|" It's genuine yak hair. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Véronique"|-0.438062071800232|"Okay, we have to leave you for a while, if you don't mind."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Théo"|0.0308780670166016|"It'll ding when it's over. We'll be back as soon as possible. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"

"Manon"|0.51768696308136|"Oh! I didn't know Nino was a famous person, too!"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nino"|-0.689598321914673|" Boo!"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Manon"|0.357815742492676|"My turn! My turn! I wanna play statues, too! Marinette!C'mon! Let's go and play hide and seek and statues in the museum!"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.630760163068771|" We can't, Manon. We came here to keep Adrien company. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Alya"|0.237215161323547|" We'll play with you. Marinette, you take good care of Adrien. He must not get bored a single second!"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.578176498413086|" Uh, what? But I—! No! Don't leave me alone with him!I mean— That's not what I meant to say... I just... I..."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|-0.770556509494781|" Are you mad at me, Marinette?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.555800676345825|"No! Of course not. Why would you say that?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|-0.253156304359436|" Because, Nino told me..."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.688206076622009|" I have no idea what Nino told you, but whatever he said, it's totally not true."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|-0.575282335281372|" Oh, so that means you like me, right? I was afraid you didn't like me."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.453345775604248|" Of course I like you... Well, like, uh, like! But, not like that!What I mean is, you're not exactly a 'good friend,' you know?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|-0.47248637676239|"Uh, okay...But then, if I'm not a good friend, what am I to you?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|-0.370107889175415|" You're...Toilets! I— I really gotta go to the toilet now. Eee! "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"

"Adrien"|-0.721218109130859|"Stop pranking, Plagg. Put that head back down before you cataclysm it. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|-0.51718458533287|"I'm sure I did something to mess up our friendship by accident. I'm so clueless about these things! "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Plagg"|-0.515446186065674|"Huh?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Adrien"|0.00141751766204834|"I gotta make it up to her. "|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"

"Alya"|-0.281883895397186|" I don't need a super power for that.I know that we're not really ourselves when we're akumatized, but it's... weird to see ourselves like that, as supervillians."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Nino"|-0.707625776529312|" It's because you don't look at them properly. These aren't supervillains, these are all the people Ladybug and Cat Noir have saved."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Alya"|-0.385132908821106|" You're right.Hey! What're you doing?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"

"Marinette"|-0.126254022121429|"Uhhh! I'm so tired of not being able to just tell him how I feel! But I'm so scared, Tikki, always so scared he'll reject me."|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Tikki"|-0.261713266372681|" You're overthinking it. You should try a game where you play a different character!"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"
"Marinette"|0.584295272827148|" Like... like role playing?"|3|64|"The Puppeteer 2"

"Bunnyx"|0.602615833282471|" My name's Bunnyx. And in the future, I'm a member of Ladybug and Cat Noir's team of superheroes. Well, the Ladybug and Cat Noir you're going to become, because right now, you two are more like Minibug and Kitty Noir. Within the team, I am the hero of the last chance.

"Cat Noir"|-0.762872233986855|" Ey! We just got you out of the stone, didn't we? Which means you must have failed somewhere, too."|3|70|"Timetagger"
"Bunnyx"|-0.72852036356926|" Yes, well, no. It was actually your fault. Or more precisely, it will be. In the future, one of your cataclysms will accidently damage my Miraculous.That's how Timetagger will be able to send me into ancient Egypt and get me stuck in stone."|3|70|"Timetagger"
"Ladybug"|-0.421918332576752|" Wait, then how are we going to do that without the Rabbit Miraculous?"|3|70|"Timetagger"

"Ladybug"|-0.63727217912674|" But wait, it doesn't make sense. I never gave you, I mean her , I mean… I never gave either of you the Miraculous."|3|70|"Timetagger"
"Future Alix"|0.173530101776123|" You haven't given it to us, yet, Minibug, because you haven't realised just how awesome I really am. But don't worry, you will, one day."|3|70|"Timetagger"

"Cat Noir"|0.586722016334534|" That Miraculous seems so powerful, how come we don't use it more often?"|3|70|"Timetagger"
"Future Alix"|-0.515332579612732|" Because traveling through time is very dangerous. Interfering with events can have serious consequences."|3|70|"Timetagger"
"Cat Noir"|-0.0479668378829956|"Oops, time to feed my Kwami, too! "|3|70|"Timetagger"
"Ladybug"|-0.403980910778046|" I don't understand. If you're from the future, then you gotta know how this all ends. Your younger self has seen it with her own eyes. Which means you obviously know how to defeat Timetagger."|3|70|"Timetagger"
"Future Alix"|-0.071386456489563|" Actually, uh… I've spent so much time in stone, I can barely remember. But I think, the logical thing to do, would be to take Timetagger back to the future, so he can be defeated by heroes his own size.I'll take care of this."|3|70|"Timetagger"
"Alix"|0.759617209434509|" Awesome!"|3|70|"Timetagger"
"Future Alix"|0.528825640678406|" One thing I remember for sure is:mini-me has to be there when I defeat Timetagger. If she's still in my memory, she must play a vital role."|3|70|"Timetagger"

"Bunnyx"|-0.32785028219223|" I told you earlier. If Cat Noir hadn't cataclysmed my Miraculous, Timetagger wouldn't be here.

The only enjoyable moment for my day was when I would come home and concoct ice cream flavors that suited my mood. Until one day, in the same way that ice cream enchanted my daily life, I wondered if my true calling would be to try and enchant other people's lives, too! That's when the truly successful career is: a blend of flavors of what you can do, what you love to do, and what you can bring to others!Strawberry and cherry for the indecisive lady, pistachio and pecan for the clear sighted young man."|4|92|"Wishmaker"

I totally get it why you're lost.But if you listen a bit more closely, the music of your band is really beautiful. You just need some time to understand it.Your music, Adrien, sounds like it's being muffled by someone else playing a sad piano tune, but your true melody is a happy one.

"Miss Bustier"|-0.617344260215759|" Come on... There are much worse people in Paris right now than Chloé Bourgeois. I'm sure people like Chloé are capable of great things. The problem is, they only think of themselves. They don't understand the meaning of love, and we can't force them to change. But perhaps we can show them by setting a good example. That's why Marinettes are so important in today's world; because they have a lot of love to give. I'm counting on you."|2|40|"Zombizou"
